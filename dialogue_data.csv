batty,"Did you get your precious 'things ' ? Police . Police man . Why do n't you have a seat . Enjoy the view . What 's going on down there ? When ? Whoops . Hello , glad to meet you . Ca n't thank you enough , Mr. Sebastian . If you had n't come along ... We 're not used to the big city . Where we come from it 's not so easy to get lost . Well stocked . I like a man who stays put . An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times . You live here all by yourself , do you ? If it would n't be too much of a bother ... a little bite to eat would be ... Well , actually Charming . There 's only three of us left . Not if everybody is doing their job here at home . How are things at home ? He knows what he 's doing . Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated . We'll appreciate him and he 'll cooperate . Why are you staring at us ? What , Sebastian ? Nexus - 6 . We can trust Sebastian , ladies . He 's been working with mechanisms all his life . He 's a wizard and a very perceptive man . Like what ? We 're not computers , Sebastian , we 're physical . Very good , Pris . Now show him why . We have a lot in common . Not only that , but we have smiliar problems . Accelerated decrepitude . But we do n't want to die quite yet . You could help us . If we do n't find help soon , Pris has n't got long to live . What about your friend , the man who owns this building ? Tyrell could help us , Sebastian . His company made us . Be better if I could talk to him in person . But he 's not an easy man to get to . When do you deliver your project ? Will you help us ? I 'm sure glad you found us , Sebastian . What do you think , Mary ? Pris ? You 're our best and only friend . The name is Batty . Roy Batty . To act without understanding could lead to the very thing the act seeks to avoid . A little talk it all I need . Yeah . It might be better if we talk in private , Sebastian . Why do n't you go home . It 's not an easy thing to meet your maker . Can the maker repair what he makes ? Had in mind something a little more radical . Death . I want more life , fucker . Why ? What about E.M.S . recombination ? Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells . But not to last . I am ? I 've done some questionable things . Nothing the God of biomechanics would n't let you in heaven for . Could you tell me where the bathroom is ? Where ? What 's the point ? You underestimate the trap , Mary . Where are you going , Sebastian ? No , you stay here with us . Out last night together . Think of yourself as a light , Mary . Shine before you 're turned off . One man . He must be good . That would n't be very sporting . Okay , but do n't kill him . Save a little for everybody . A masterpiece . Turn out the lights , Pris . You wan na play ? Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent . I thought you were supposed to be good . Aren't you the man ? ! This is how we do it up there , lad ! Come on ! Not hurt , are you ? You better get it up or I 'm going to have to kill you . Unless you 're alive you can't play . And if you do n't play , you do n't get to be alive . That 's the spirit . Straight does n't seem to be good enough . You do n't have a chance , do you ? Looks like I 'm gon na have to scale it down for you . Give you a handicap . I wo n't run through any more walls . Okay ? I promise to use the doors . Okay ? Come on , let 's use that brain ! Think ! We need a little resilience around here ! Where are those balls of yours ? ! Let 's see a little bravery ! That was irrational of me -- not to mention unsportsmanlike . Won't happen again . I 'll be down the hall when you're ready . Where you going ? No cheating . A promise is a promise . I 'll honor the handicapped , but we got ta play on the top floor . You go get your laser gun now . And I 'll give you a few seconds before I come . Five ! Six ! Oh , I wonder where he is . Not in here , I do n't think . Eight ! Maybe here . Does n't sound like it . Nine ! Ten ! One point for you . Ho ho ! Try it again ! What 's wrong ? Do n't you like me ? I 'm what we 've made ! What 's wrong ? Are n't you a lover of Faster , Bigger and Better ? ! It 's time to die . Ah ! That 's for you . Stick it in your ear and push . If that does n't work , try the eye . Believe me , it 'll be better for you than what I 'm about to do . Well ? Crap .",1
travis,"No Sir . Yes . I ca n't sleep nights . I know . I tried that . I ride around nights mostly . Subways , buses . See things . Figur'd I might as well get paid for it . You kiddin ? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night ? I 'll work anywhere , anytime . I know I ca n't be choosy . Clean . Real clean . As clean as my conscience . Sorry , sir . I did n't mean that . Also clean . Some . Here and there . Honorable discharge . May 1971 . No , I want long shifts . So I hear . No . Yes , Sir . April 10 , 1972 . Thank God for the rain which has helped wash the garbage and trash off the sidewalks . I 'm working a single now , which means stretch-shifts , six to six , sometimes six to eight in the a.m. , six days a week . It 's a hustle , but it keeps me busy . I can take in three to three-fifty a week , more with skims . Why should it be grounded ? Then it 's a good guess it 's grounded . Have you tried the telephone ? No . I work the whole city , up , down , do n't make no difference to me - does to some . Some wo n't take spooks - Hell , do n't make no difference tom me . They 're all animals anyway . All the animals come out at night : Whores , skunk pussies , buggers , queens , fairies , dopers , junkies , sick , venal . Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets . Each night when I return the cab to the garage I have to clean the come off the back seat . Some nights I clean off the blood . What is your name ? My name is Travis . No , I 'm serious , really ... That 's fine . Twelve hours of work and I still can not sleep . The days dwindle on forever and do not end . All my life needed was a sense of direction , a sense of someplace to go . I do not believe one should devote his life to morbid self- attention , but should become a person like other people . I first saw her at Palantine Campaign Headquarters at 58th and Broadway . She was wearing a yellow dress , answering the phone at her desk . She appeared like an angel out of this open sewer . Out of this filthy mass . She is alone : They can not touch her . Hey Wizard . Some fleet driver for Bell just cut up . Just heard it on the radio . Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up . Just heard it on the radio . No , just some crazy fucker . Cut have his ear off . In the jungle . 122nd . Huh ? I have . Nah . I suppose not . I want to volunteer . No . I want to volunteer to you . Because you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen . Who mam ? Oh , I think he 's a wonderful man . Make a great , great President . Yes , mam . Welfare , mam ? I think the Senator's right . People should work for a living . I do . I like to work . Every day . Get those old coots off welfare and make 'em work for a change . I 'm a good worker , Betsy mam , a real good worker . If you do n't mind , mam , I 'd rather work for you . Well , Betsy mam , I drive a taxi at night . If you do n't mind , mam , I 'd be mighty pleased if you 'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me . Well , Betsy mam , I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day . And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones , and I say to myself , that 's a lonely girl . She needs a friend . And I 'm gon na be her friend . It 's just to the corner , mam . In broad daytime . Nothing can happen . I 'll be there to protect you . Oh , I appreciate that , Betsy mam . I 'll be here at four o'clock exactly . And ... ah ... Betsy ... My name is Travis . April 26 , 1972 . Four o'clock p.m . I took Betsy to the Mayfair Coffee Shop on Broadway ... I had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese . I think that was a good selection . Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish . She could have had anything she wanted . I know what you mean . I 've got the same problems . I just ca n't get things organized . Little things , I mean . Like my room , my possessions . I should get one of those signs that says , `` One of these days I'm Gon na Organezizied '' . I can believe that . Oh , uptown . You know . Some joint . It ai n't much . I had a regular job for a while , days . You know , doin ' this , doin' that . But I did n't have anything to do at night . I got kinda lonely , you know , just wandering around . So I decided to works nights . It ain't good to be alone , you know . Yeah , well ... In a cab you get to meet people . You meet lotsa people . It 's good for you . Just people people , you know . Just people . Had a dead man once . He 'd been shot . I did n't know that . He just crawled into the back seat , said `` West 45th Street '' and conked out . I shot the meter off , for one thing . I knew I was n't goimg to get paid . Then I dropped him off at the cop shop . They took him . Oh , you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab . Especially when the moon's out . The full moon . One night I had three or four weirdoes in a row and I looked up and , sure enough , there it was - the full moon . Oh , yeah . People will do anything in front of a taxi driver . I mean anything . People too cheap to rent a hotel room , people scoring dope , people shooting up , people who want to embarrass you . It 's like you 're not even there , not even a person . Nobody knows you . I know . I could have picked you up . Late one night . About three . At the plaza . No . It was you . You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks . If it was n't for a drunk I would have picked you up . He wanted to go to the DMZ . South Bronx . The worst . I tried to ditch him , but he was already in the cab , so I had to take him . That 's the law . Otherwise I would have picked you up . You 'd be surprised how often you see the same people , get the same fare . People have patterns . They do more or less the same things every day . I can tell . I did n't mean you . But just ordinary people . A guy I know - Dough-Boy - met his wife that way . They got to talking . She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop , taking her home with the flag up . Well , no ... not really ... had some famous people in the cab . I got this guy who makes lasers . Not regular lasers , not the big kind . Little lasers , pocket sized , small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio , like a gun , you know . Like a ray gun . Zap . I work a single , which means there 's no replacement - no second man on the cab . Six to six , sometimes eight . Seventy-two hours a week . Sometimes 76 or 80 . Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning . Eighty miles a day , a hundred miles a night . it keeps ya busy . What ? I 'm no pusher , Betsy . Honest . I never have pushed . I did n't mean that , Travis . Just the part about the contradiction . Oh . Who was that again ? Yeah . Yes . I do n't follow music too much . You work at night , you get an instinct . You can smell them . The big tippers , the stiffs , the trouble makers . Quarter is good tip for Manhattan . Queens is better , Brooklyn is best . go for the guys with suitcases . The rich are the worst tippers , hooks are lousy . Spooks are okay , but they don't live at Park Ave after all . I called Betsy again at her office , and she said maybe we could go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow . That 's my day off . At first she hesitated , but I called her again and she agreed . Betsy . Betsy what ? I forgot to ask her last name again . Damn . I've got to remember stuff like that . Say , are n't you Charles Palantine , the candidate ? Well , I 'm one of your biggest supporters . I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you . I 'm sure you 'll win , sir . Everybody I know is going to vote for you . I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy . I do n't know , sir . I do n't follow political issues much . Well , he should clean up this city here . It 's full of filth and scum . Scum and filth . It 's like an open sewer . I can hardly take it . Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away . We need a President that would clean up this whole mess . Flush it out . Damn straight . Thank you , sir . You 're a good man , sir . He 'll , what else can I do with it all ? Yeah , well my stereo player is broke . But I 'm sure the record is OK . I do n't follow music much . I 'd like to though . Honest . No . I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player . I bought a couple of tickets . No , these are the kind that couples go to . They 're not like the other movies . All kinds of couples go . Honest . I 've seen them . Damn . I forgot to get the Coca-Cola . Where are you going ? What do you mean ? Well , I do n't follow movies too much ... This is sort of high class ... Well ... mostly ... We can go to another movie if you like , I do n't care . I got money . There 's plenty ... ... there 's plenty of movies around here . I have n't seen any of them , but I 'm sure they 're good . You mean you do n't want to go to a movie ? There 's plenty of movies around here . Huh ? But ... Betsy ... What about the record ? Can I call you ? Please , Betsy , I bought it for you . But I got a taxi . May 8 , 1972 . My life has taken another turn again . The days move along with regularity ... ... one day indistinguishable from the next , a long continuous chain , then suddenly - there is a change . I tried to call her several times . you feeling better ? You said you did n't feel so good ... But after the first call , she would no longer come to the phone . I also sent flowers with no luck . I should not dwell on such things , but set them behind me . The smell of the flowers only made me sicker . The headaches got worse I think I 've got stomach cancer . I should not complain so . `` You 're only as healthy as you feel . '' I realize now how much she is like the others , so cold and distant . Many people are like that . They're like a union . I 'm off duty . No , I 'm off duty . It was on . it just takes a while to warm up . Like a TV . Yeah . Yeah . 20 bucks ? You got a .44 Magnum ? I got money . I want a .32 . Revolver . And a palm gun . That .22 there . How much for everything . How much to get a permit to carry ? Nah , this 'll be fine . Is there a firing range around ? Huh ? Yeah . I was all around . One hospital , then the next . They 'd never get me to go back . They 'd have to shoot me first . You got anything to carry these in ? Huh ? Nah . I ai n't interested . May 29 , 1972 . I must get in shape . Too much sitting has ruined my body . Twenty-five push-ups each morning , one hundred sit-ups , one hundred knee-bends . I have quit smoking . Total organization is necessary . Every muscle must be tight . My body fights me always . It won't work , it wo n't sleep , it won't shit , it wo n't eat . The idea had been growing in my brain ... ... for some time . True Force . All the king 's men can not put it back together again . Listen you screwheads : Here is a man ... ... who would n't take it any more , a man who stood up against the scum , the cunts , the dogs , the filth . Here is ... Hey 'Melio . Hey dude ! You 're gon na have to cover me on this one , 'Melio . I ca n't stay for the cop show . The hell I ca n't . It 's no sweat for you . What is this for you , number five ? Thanks a lot . Damn , damn . Slow . Hey Wiz , just a second . I wan na talk to you . Hey Wiz . Wiz ? Look , ah , we never talked much , you and me ... I wanted to ask you something , on account you 've been around so long . Well , I just , you know ... Real down . Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I 'm gon na do . I get some real crazy ideas , you know ? Just go out and do somethin . Yeah . Like do anything , you know . That 's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard , Wizard . Neither do I , I guess . Thanks . Are you a Secret Service Man ? I 've seen a lot of suspicious- looking people around here today . Oh , lots . I do n't know where they all are now . There used to be one standing over there . Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man ? I kinda thought I might make a good one . I 'm very observant . I was in the Army too . And I 'm good with crowds . What kind of guns do you guys use ? .38 's ? You would , huh ? My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a `` K. '' K-R-I-N-K-L-E . I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue , Fair Lawn , New Jersey . Zip code 07410 . Got that ? Great , hey . Thanks a lot . June 11 . Eight rallies in six more days . The time is coming . Dear Father and Mother , June is the month , I remember , which brings not only your wedding anniversary , but also Father 's Day and Mother 's birthday . I 'm sorry I ca n't remember the exact dates , but I hope this card will take care of all of them . I 'm sorry I again can not send you my address like I promised to last year , but the sensitive nature of my work for the Army demands utmost secrecy . I know you will understand . I am healthy and well and making lots of money . I have been going with a girl for several months and I know you would be proud if you could see her . Her name is Betsy , but I can tell you no more than that . Sorry , officer . No , officer . I hope this card finds you all well , as it does me . I hope no one has died . Do n't worry about me . One day there will be a knock on the door and it will be me . Love , Travis . Hello . Well ... I guess so . You name Sport ? Your name Sport ? I 'm no cop . I want some action . Shit . I 'm no cop . I 'm hip . Why you hang around with them greasers ? Yeah . From the likes of them . What 's your name ? That ai n't much of a name . What 's your real name ? What 's your real name ? That 's a nice name . Do n't you remember me ? Button your shirt . I drive a taxi . You tried to get away one night . Remember ? You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you . It do n't matter . I 'm gon na get you outta here . I do n't want to make it . I came here to get you out . Ca n't you listen to me ? Do n't you want to get out of here ? But you 're the one that wanted to get away . You 're the one that came into my cab . Do they drug you ? Listen ... I want to help you . Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Do n't you understand anything ? Do you understand why I came here ? Do n't you want to go ? But that one night ? Well , I tried . Can I see you again ? No , I mean really . This is nothing for a person to do . Well tomorrow noon there 's a ... I got a ... O.K . It 's a date . I 'll see you here , then . So long , Iris . Sweet Iris . Here 's the twenty bucks , old man . You better damn well spend it right . Where is home ? Where ? I ai n't ever been there , but it do n't seem like such a bad place . But you ca n't live like this . It's hell . Girls should live at home . Young girls are supposed to dress up , go to school , play with boys , you know , that kinda stuff . At least I do n't walk the streets like a skunk pussy . I do n't screw and fuck with killers and junkies . That fella `` Sport '' looks like a killer to me . Huh ? He looks like a killer . He shoots dope too . He 's worse than an animal . Jail's too good for scum like that . I never been to a commune . I don't know . I saw pictures in a magazine , and it did n't look very clean to me . Me ? I could never go to a place like that . I ... I do n't get along with people like that . Besides , I 've got to stay here . I 've got something important to do . I ca n't leave . I ca n't say -- it 's top secret . I 'm doing something for the Army . The cab thing is just part time . Do I look like a narc ? What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard ? You just gon na leave 'em ? Cops do n't do nothin . You ca n't leave 'em to do the same to other girls . You should get rid of them . I do n't know . Just should , though . Somebody should kill 'em . Nobody'd miss 'em . I 'm sorry , Iris . I did n't mean that . Well , Iris , I look at it this way . A lot of girls come into my cab , some of them very beautiful . And I figure all day long men have been after them : trying to touch them , talk to them , ask them out . And they hate it . So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all . So I do n't say a thing . I pretend I 'm not even there . I figure they 'll understand that and appreciate me for it . I think you should go home , but otherwise I think you should go . It would be great for you . You have to get away from here . The city 's a sewer , you got ta get out of it . I ca n't . Otherwise , I would . I 'll give you the money to go . I do n't want you to take any from those guys . I want to -- what else can I do with my money ? You may not see me again -- for a while . My work may take me out of New York . My whole life has pointed in one direction . I see that now . There never has been any choice for me . Loneliness has followed me all my life . The life of loneliness pursues me wherever I go : in bars , cars , coffee shops , theaters , stores , sidewalks . There is no escape . I am God 's lonely man . I am not a fool . I will no longer fool myself . I will no longer let myself fall apart , become a joke and object of ridicule . I know there is no longer any hope . I can not continue this hollow , empty fight . I must sleep . What hope is there for me ? Hey , Sport . How are things ? How are things in the pimp business , hey Sport ? I 'm here to see Iris . Yeah , Iris . You know anybody by that name ? You carry a gun ? Get it . Show it to me . Now suck on that . Pgghew ! Pgghew ! Hey Charlie T . Shit . Hello , Betsy . I see where Palantine got the nomination . Well , I hope he wins . Oh , I got over that . It was nothing , really . The papers always blow these things up . A little stiffness . That 'll go away . I just sleep more , that 's all . Here we are . No , no , please . This fare 's on me . Please . Yeah . Sure .",1
red,"Yes , sir . Absolutely . I 've learned my lesson . I can honestly say I 'm a changed man . I 'm no longer a danger to society . That 's the God 's honest truth . No doubt about it . There 's a con like me in every prison in America , I guess . I 'm the guy who can get it for you . Cigarettes , a bag of reefer if you 're partial , a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid 's high school graduation . Damn near anything , within reason . Yes sir , I 'm a regular Sears & Roebuck . So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him , I told him no problem . And it was n't . Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was bangin ' . On the outside , he 'd been vice- president of a large Portland bank . Good work for a man as young as he was , when you consider how conservative banks were back then . There they are , boys . The Human Charm Bracelet . Bear Catholic ? Pope shit in the woods ? Smokes or coin , bettor 's choice . High roller . Who 's your horse ? That 's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass . Any takers ? I must admit I did n't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him . He might ' a been important on the outside , but in here he was just a little turd in prison grays . Looked like a stiff breeze could blow him over . That was my first impression of the man . Little fella on the end . Definitely . I stake half a pack . Any takers ? C'mon , boys , who 's gon na prove me wrong ? Floyd , Skeet , Joe , Heywood . Four brave souls , ten smokes apiece . That 's it , gentlemen , this window 's closed . The first night 's the toughest , no doubt about it . They march you in naked as the day you 're born , fresh from a Bible reading , skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you ... ... and when they put you in that cell , when those bars slam home , that 's when you know it 's for real . Old life blown away in the blink of an eye ... a long cold season in hell stretching out ahead ... nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it . Most new fish come close to madness the first night . Somebody always breaks down crying . Happens every time . The only question is , who's it gon na be ? It 's as good a thing to bet on as any , I guess . I had my money on Andy Dufresne ... I remember my first night . Seems a long time ago now . The boys always go fishin ' with first-timers ... and they do n't quit till they reel someone in . His first night in the joint , Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes . He never made a sound ... Give him some ' a your cigarettes instead , cheap bastard . The wife-killin ' banker . I keep my ear to the ground . Why'd you do it ? Hell , you 'll fit right in , then . Everyone 's innocent in here , don't you know that ? Heywood ! What are you in for , boy ? People say you 're a cold fish . They say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary . That true ? Ai n't made up my mind yet . I 'm known to locate certain things from time to time . They seem to fall into my hands . Maybe it's 'cause I 'm Irish . What is it and why ? If you wanted a toothbrush , I would n't ask questions . I 'd just quote a price . A toothbrush , see , is a non-lethal sort of object . Rocks . Quartz ? So ? Yeah , that or maybe plant your toy in somebody 's skull ? No ? Just wait . Word gets around . The Sisters have taken a real shine to you , yes they have . Especially Bogs . Neither are they . You have to be human first . They do n't qualify . Bull queers take by force , that's all they want or understand . I'd grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you . That comes free . But you understand my concern . Then I guess you wan na escape . Tunnel under the wall maybe ? I miss the joke . What 's so funny ? What 's this item usually go for ? My standard mark-up 's twenty percent , but we 're talkin ' about a special object . Risk goes up , price goes up . Call it ten bucks even . I 'll see what I can do . But it 's a waste of money . Folks who run this place love surprise inspections . They turn a blind eye to some things , but not a gadget like that . They 'll find it , and you 'll lose it . Mention my name , we 'll never do business again . Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum . Red . The name 's Red . I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby . He had a quiet way about him , a walk and a talk that just was n't normal around here . He strolled . like a man in a park without a care or worry . Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place . Yes , I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start . He was a man who adapted fast . Years later , I found out he'd brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars ... When they check you into this hotel , one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works , just to make sure you 're not carrying anything . But a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there . That 's how Andy joined our happy little Shawshank family with more than five hundred dollars on his person . Determination . Andy was right . I finally got the joke . It would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these . Dufresne . I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight , and the Sisters let him be . I wish I could tell you that , but prison is no fairy-tale world . He never said who did it ... but we all knew . Things went on like that for a while . Prison life consists of routine , and then more routine . Every so often , Andy would show up with fresh bruises . The Sisters kept at him . Sometimes he was able to fight them off ... sometimes not . He always fought , that 's what I remember . He fought because he knew if he did n't fight , it would make it that much easier not to fight the next time . Half the time it landed him in the infirmary ... ... the other half , it landed him in solitary . Warden Norton 's `` grain & drain '' vacation . Bread , water , and all the privacy you could want . And that 's how it went for Andy . That was his routine . I do believe those first two years were the worst for him . And I also believe if things had gone on that way , this place would have got the best of him . But then , in the spring of 1949 , the powers-that-be decided that ... It was outdoor detail , and May is one damn fine month to be workin' outdoors . More than a hundred men volunteered for the job . Would n't you know it ? Me and some fellas I know were among the names called . Only cost us a pack of smokes per man . I made my usual twenty percent , of course . Crying shame . Some folks got it awful bad . Hey , you nuts ? Keep your eyes on your pail ! Andy ! Come back ! Shit ! God damn it ... And that 's how it came to pass , that on the second-to-last day of the job , the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of '49 ... ... wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning , drinking icy cold Black Label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison . The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous . We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders , and felt like free men . We could ' a been tarring the roof of one of our own houses . We were the Lords of all Creation . As for Andy , he spent that break hunkered in the shade , a strange little smile on his face , watching us drink his beer . You could argue he 'd done it to curry favor with the guards . Or maybe make a few friends among us cons . Me , I think he did it just to feel normal again ... if only for a short while . King me . ... and totally fuckin' inexplicable . Hate that game . You come to the right place . I'm the man who can get things . That 'd take you years . How 's that rock-hammer workin ' out anyway ? Scratch your name on your wall yet ? Andy ? I guess we 're gettin ' to be friends , ai n't we ? I ask a question ? Why 'd you do it ? Murder . Same as you . The only guilty man in Shawshank . Here 's the good part . Bugs come out of the walls to get his ass . Sure . What do you want ? No problem . Take a few weeks . Do n't have her stuffed down my pants this very moment , sorry to say . Relax . What are you so nervous about ? She 's just a woman . Bogs did n't put anything in Andy's mouth , and neither did his friends . What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life ... Andy spent a month in traction . Bogs spent a week in the hole . Two things never happened again after that . The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again ... ... and Bogs never walked again . They transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate . To my knowledge , he lived out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw . I 'm thinkin ' Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary . Man likes to play chess . Let 's get him some rocks . Horse apple . No , horse shit . Petrified . Despite a few hitches , the boys came through in fine style ... ... and by the week Andy was due back , we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till Rapture . Also got a big shipment in that week . Cigarettes , chewing gum , shoelaces , playing cards with naked ladies on 'em , you name it ... ... and , of course , the most important item . Tossin ' cells was just an excuse . Truth is , Norton wanted to size Andy up . Makin ' yourself some friends , Andy . Got you out of the laundry , didn't it ? So Andy started writing a letter a week , just like he said . And just like Norton said , Andy got no answers . But still he kept on . The following April , Andy did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank . Year after that , he did them all ... including the warden 's . Year after that , they rescheduled the start of the intramural season to coincide with tax season ... The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2 's . Yes sir , Andy was a regular H & R Block . In fact , he got so busy at tax time , he was allowed a staff . Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year , and that was fine by me . And still he kept sending those letters ... What the hell 's going on ? No . We 'll handle this . Ai n't that right , Brooks ? Just settle down and we 'll talk about it , okay ? Why ? What 's Heywood done to you ? Yeah , that 's right . That 's what everybody says . You 've had worse from shaving . What 'd you do to set him off ? Ai n't that bad , old hoss . Wo n't be long till you 're squiring pretty young girls on your arm and telling 'em lies . Heywood , enough . Ai n't nothing wrong with Brooksie . He 's just institutionalized , that 's all . Man 's been here fifty years . This place is all he knows . In here , he 's an important man , an educated man . A librarian . Out there , he's nothing but a used-up old con with arthritis in both hands . Couldn't even get a library card if he applied . You see what I 'm saying ? Believe what you want . These walls are funny . First you hate 'em , then you get used to 'em . After long enough , you get so you depend on 'em . That 's `` institutionalized . '' Goddamn right . They send you here for life , and that 's just what they take . Part that counts , anyway . He should ' a died in here , goddamn it . Is that Jake ? It never would have occurred to us , if not for Andy . It was his idea . We all agreed it was the right thing to do ... Lord . Brooks was a sinner . Jake was just a crow . Neither was much to look at . Both got institutionalized . See what you can do for 'em . Amen . I have no idea to this day what them two Italian ladies were singin ' about . Truth is , I don't want to know . Some things are best left unsaid . I like to think they were singin ' about something so beautiful it ca n't be expressed in words , and makes your heart ache because of it . I tell you , those voices soared . Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream . It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away ... and for the briefest of moments -- every last man at Shawshank felt free . It pissed the warden off something terrible . Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt . Oh , they let you tote that record player down there , huh ? I could ' a swore they confiscated that stuff . Played a mean harmonica as a younger man . Lost my taste for it . Didn't make much sense on the inside . Forget ? Hope is a dangerous thing . Drive a man insane . It 's got no place here . Better get used to the idea . Yes sir , without a doubt . I can say I 'm a changed man . No danger to society , that 's the God 's honest truth . Absolutely rehabilitated . Same old , same old . Thirty years . Jesus . When you say it like that ... It 's very pretty , Andy . Thank you . Not today . Andy was as good as his word . He kept writing to the State Senate . Two letters a week instead of one . In 1959 , the folks up Augusta way finally clued in to the fact they could n't buy him off with just a 200 dollar check . Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of 500 dollars , just to shut him up . Those checks came once a year like clockwork . You 'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it . He made deals with book clubs , charity groups ... he bought remaindered books by the pound ... I got here an auto repair manual , and a book on soap carving . Maybe that should go under educational too . By the year Kennedy was shot , Andy had transformed a broom closet smelling of turpentine into the best prison library in New England . That was also the year Warden Norton instituted his famous `` Inside-Out '' program . You may remember reading about it . It made all the papers and got his picture in LIFE magazine . Nobody asked you . None of the inmates were invited to express their views ... 'Course , Norton failed to mention to the press that `` bare minimum of expense '' is a fairly loose term . There are a hundred different ways to skim off the top . Men , materials , you name it . And , oh my Lord , how the money rolled in ... And behind every shady deal , behind every dollar earned ... ... there was Andy , keeping the books . Got his fingers in a lot of pies , from what I hear . Money like that can be a problem . Sooner or later you got ta explain where it came from . It 's clean as a virgin 's whistle ? Jesus . They ever catch on , he's gon na wind up wearing a number himself . I 'm sure you 're good , but all that paper leaves a trail . Anybody gets too curious -- FBI , IRS , whatever -- that trail 's gon na lead to somebody . Who then ? Who ? Yeah , okay , but who the hell is he ? You ca n't just make a person up . Jesus . Did I say you were good ? You 're Rembrandt . Does it ever bother you ? To keep you happy and doing the laundry . Money instead of sheets . Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965 on a two year stretch for B & E . Cops caught him sneakin ' TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney . Young punk , Mr. Rock n ' Roll , cocky as hell ... We liked him immediately . As it turns out , Tommy had himself a young wife and new baby girl ... Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets ... or his child growing up not knowing her daddy ... Whatever it was , something lit a fire under that boy 's ass . So Andy took Tommy under his wing . Started walking him through his ABCs ... Tommy took to it pretty well , too . Boy found brains he never knew he had . After a while , you could n't pry those books out of hands . Ass in gear , son ! You 're putting us behind ! Before long , Andy started him on his course requirements . He really liked the kid , that was part of it . Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shitheap . But that was n't the only reason ... Prison time is slow time . Sometimes it feels like stop-time . So you do what you can to keep going ... Some fellas collect stamps . Others build matchstick houses . Andy built a library . Now he needed a new project . Tommy was it . It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks . The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall ... In prison , a man 'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied . By 1966 ... right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams ... it was lovely Racquel . That 's crap , son . He 's proud of you . Proud as a hen . We been friends a long time . I know him as good as anybody . Smart as they come . Used to be a banker on the outside . Murder . You would n't think , lookin ' at him . Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro . Greased 'em both . C'mon , boy , back to work ... Andy ? Like hell . You did n't pull the trigger , and you did n't convict him . Since '47 . Going on nineteen years . Board of Education . Looks that way . You gon na open it or stick your thumb up your butt ? Well , shit . That do n't make you a murderer . Bad husband , maybe . Feel bad about it if you want . But you did n't pull the trigger . Bad luck ? Jesus . Sure . When I got a long white beard and about three marbles left rolling around upstairs . Zihuatanejo ? Jesus , Andy . I could n't hack it on the outside . Been in here too long . I 'm an institutional man now . Like old Brooks Hatlen was . Bullshit . In here I 'm the guy who can get it for you . Out there , all you need are Yellow Pages . I would n't know where to begin . Pacific Ocean ? Hell . Like to scare me to death , somethin ' that big . Goddamn it , Andy , stop ! Do n't do that to yourself ! Talking shitty pipedreams ! Mexico 's down there , and you 're in here , and that 's the way it is ! Andy ? Lots of hayfields there . What ? What 's buried there ? I tell you , the man was talkin' crazy . I 'm worried , I truly am . Every man 's got a breaking point . Yeah . Sure . That 's right . I have had some long nights in stir . Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts , time can draw out like a blade ... That was the longest night of my life ... Well what ? No sir , he did n't ! They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to go in the hole . He wasn't much in the brains department , but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job ... ... he was willing to go . Probably thought he 'd win a Bronze Star or something . It was his third day on the job . And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont losing his last few meals . The whole cellblock heard it . I mean , it echoed . I laughed myself right into solitary . Two week stretch . It 's shit , it 's shit , oh my God it 's shit ... Andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole . Now I knew what he meant . In 1966 , Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison . All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes , a bar of soap , and an old rock-hammer damn near worn down to the nub . I remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it . Andy did it in less than twenty . Andy loved geology . I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature . An ice age here , a million years of mountain-building there , plates of bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia ... Geology is the study of pressure and time . That 's all it takes , really . Pressure and time . That and a big damn poster . Like I said . In prison , a man 'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied . It turns out Andy 's favorite hobby was totin ' his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time ... While the rest of us slept , Andy spent years workin ' the nightshift ... Probably took him most of a year just to get his head through . I guess after Tommy was killed , Andy decided he 'd been here just about long enough . Andy did like he was told . Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine . The guard simply did n't notice . Neither did I. I mean , seriously , how often do you really look at a man 's shoes ? Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit-smelling foulness I ca n't even imagine . Or maybe I just do n't want to . Five hundred yards . The length of five football fields . Just shy of half a mile . The next morning , right about the time Racquel was spilling her little secret ... ... a man nobody ever laid eyes on before strolled into the Casco Bank of Portland . Until that moment , he did n't exist -- except on paper . He had all the proper I.D . Driver's license , birth certificate , social security card . The signature was a spot-on match . Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning . All told , he blew town with better than 370 thousand dollars of Warden Norton 's money . Severance pay for nineteen years . I was n't there to see it , but I hear Byron Hadley was sobbing like a little girl when they took him away . Norton had no intention of goin' that quietly . I like to think the last thing that went through his head ... other than that bullet ... was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him . Not long after the warden deprived us of his company , I got a postcard in the mail . It was blank . But the postmark said , `` McNary , Texas . '' McNary . Right on the border . That's where Andy crossed . When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down , it makes me laugh all over again ... Andy Dufresne , who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side . Andy Dufresne , headed for the Pacific . Those of us who knew him best talk about him often . I swear , the stuff he pulled . It always makes us laugh . Sometimes it makes me sad , though , Andy being gone . I have to remind myself that some birds are n't meant to be caged , that 's all . Their feathers are just too bright ... ... and when they fly away , the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice ... but still , the place you live is that much more drab and empty that they 're gone . I guess I just miss my friend . But there are times I curse him for the dreams he left behind ... ... dreams where I am lost in a warm place with no memory . An ocean so big it strikes me dumb . Waves so quiet they strike me deaf . Sunshine so bright it strikes me blind . It is a place that is blue beyond reason . Bluer than can possibly exist . Bluer than my mind can possibly grasp . I am terrified . There is no way home . Andy . I know you 're in that place . Look at the stars for me just after sunset . Touch the sand ... wade in the water ... and feel free . I heard you . Rehabilitated . Let's see now . You know , come to think of it , I have no idea what that means . I know what you think it means . Me , I think it 's a made-up word , a poli- tician 's word . A word so young fellas like you can wear a suit and tie and have a job . What do you really want to know ? Am I sorry for what I did ? Not a day goes by I do n't feel regret , and not because I 'm in here or because you think I should . I look back on myself the way I was ... stupid kid who did that terrible crime ... wish I could talk sense to him . Tell him how things are . But I ca n't . That kid 's long gone , this old man is all that's left , and I have to live with that . `` Rehabilitated ? '' That 's a bullshit word , so you just go on ahead and stamp that form there , sonny , and stop wasting my damn time . Truth is , I do n't give a shit . Sir ? Restroom break sir ? Thirty years I 've been asking permission to piss . I ca n't squeeze a drop without say-so . Women , too , that 's the other thing . I forgot they were half the human race . There 's women everywhere , every shape and size . I find myself semi-hard most of the time , cursing myself for a dirty old man . Not a brassiere to be seen , nipples poking out at the world . Jeezus , pleeze-us . Back in my day , a woman out in public like that would have been arrested and given a sanity hearing . They 're calling this the Summer of Love . Summer of Loonies , you ask me . Yes sir . That I am . Things got different out here . Guess the world moved on . There is a harsh truth to face . No way I 'm gon na make it on the outside . All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole . Terrible thing , to live in fear . Brooks Hatlen knew it . Knew it all too well . All I want is to be back where things make sense . Where I wo n't have to be afraid all the time . Only one thing stops me . A promise I made to Andy . Get busy living or get busy dying . That is goddamn right . For the second time in my life , I am guilty of committing a crime . Parole violation . I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that . Not for an old crook like me . McNary , Texas ? I find I am so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head . I think it is the excitement only a free man can feel , a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain ... I hope I can make it across the border . I hope to see my friend and shake his hand . I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams . I hope . I 'm known to locate certain things from time to time .",0
roth,"Sit down , this is almost over . You follow the baseball games ? I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon . One of the things I love about this country . I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919 ... I heard you had some trouble . What a mistake ; people behaving like that , with guns . It was my understanding we left all that behind . But , let me tell you , the important thing is that you're all right . Good health is the most important thing ; more than success ; more than power ; more than money . You 're a considerate young man . However I can help you ... We do favors for each other ... Nothing is more important . It 's always bad for business ; but you have no choice . Of course you must keep control of your family . Michael , these things are unimportant . Who should be the manager of a dime store , Joe or Jack ? Unimportant . You do what you think is right . You 're a young man , and I 'm old and sick . What we do together in the next few months will be history , Michael ; it has never been done before . We will do this historical thing together , and even your Father could never dream it would be possible . We are bigger than U.S. Steel , you and me ... because in America , anything is possible ! But soon I will be dead , and it will all belong to you . I still do n't speak Spanish , Michael . I hope my age is correct : I am always accurate about my age . Everything we 've learned in Vegas is true here ; but we can go further . The bigger , the swankier , the plusher the store , the more a sense of legitimacy , and the bigger business we do . A smaller piece . What we've proposed to the Cuban Government is that it put up half the cash on a dollar for dollar basis . Thank you . We can find people in the United States who will put up our share for a small piece of the action , yet we will retain control . A hundred million dollars . But only if this Government relaxes its restrictions on importing building materials ; we 'll need some new laws , too , but that will be no difficulty . As much as seventy percent . Also , I 'm working out an arrangement with the Minister of Labor so that all our pit bosses , stick-men and Dealers , can be considered specialized technicians eligible for two year visas . As of now they 're only allowed in Cuba for six months at a time . In short , we 're in a full partnership with the Cuban Government . Here are applications from Friends all over the States . I understand Santo Virgilio in Tampa is trying to make his own deal . Well , the Cuban Government will brush him off . The Lakeville Road Boys are going to take over the Nacionale here . I 'm planning a new hotel casino to be known as Riviera . The new Capri will go to the Corleone Family . Then there 's the Sevilla Biltmore ; the Havana Hilton , which is going to cost twenty-four million -- Cuban banks will put up half , the Teamsters will bankroll the rest . Generally , there will be friends for all our friends including the Lieutenant Governor of Nevada ; Eddie Levine of Newport will bring in the Pennino Brothers , Dino and Eddie ; they 'll handle actual casino operations . Enjoy . This country has had rebels for the last fifty years ; it 's part of their blood . Believe me , I know ... I 've been coming here since the twenties ; we were running molasses out of Havana when you were a baby . To trucks owned by your father . We 'll talk when we 're alone . You have to be careful what you say in front of the others ... they frighten easy . It 's always been that way , most men frighten easy . My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland . He thinks it 's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels . Then you have to trace it . Michael , people here look at me as a reliable man . I ca n't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man . But you know all that ; there 's nothing you can learn from me . You should n't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner . Except the President of the United States . If only I could live to see it , kid ; to be there with you . How beautifully we 've done it , step by step . Here , protected , free to make our profits without the Justice Department , the FBI ; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government . Ninety miles , just a small step , looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States , and having the cash to make it possible . Make it fast ; I do n't want to chance him being seen . I want my own doctor ; fly him in from Miami . I do n't trust a doctor who ca n't speak English . Honey , go down to the casino ? I do . Play the Bingo game . My sixth sense tells me you have a bag full of money in your hand . Still no word of your courier ? We 'll find him . But at least this will satisfy our friends here . You 've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home . I understand your brother is here as well ; I hope he 'll come . You 're a careful kid , and that's good . But look . An international dispatch on the wire service . American journalism , not propaganda . The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels . All but their radio station . Terrible . I 'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting . Why ... the Rosato Brothers . There was this kid that I grew up with ; he was a couple years younger than me , and sort of looked up to me , you know . We did our first work together , worked our way out of the street . Things were good and we made the most of it . During prohibition , we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune ; your father too . I guess as much as anyone , I loved him and trusted him . Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I . 's on the way to the West Coast . That kid 's name was Moe Greene , and the city he invented was Las Vegas . This was a great man ; a man with vision and guts ; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town . Someone put a bullet through his eye ; no one knows who gave the order . When I heard about it I was n't angry . I knew Moe ; I knew he was headstrong , and talking loud , and saying stupid things . So when he turned up dead , I let it go , and said to myself : this is the business we 've chosen . I never asked , who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business . There 's three million dollars on that table . I 'm going to lie down , maybe take a nap . When I wake up , if it 's still there , I 'll know I have a partner . If it 's gone , then I 'll know I do n't . Hyman Suchowsky . Yeah . Suchowsky . Hyman Suchowsky . Arnold Rothstein . Yes , I know . I am a retired investor on a pension , and I wished to live there as a Jew in the twilight of my life ... I 'm an old man ; at my age , it 's too late to start worrying . I 'm a retired investor , living on a pension ... I came home to vote in the Presidential election , because they would n't give me an absentee ballot ...",1
bogs,"You 're some sweet punk . You been broke in yet ? Hard to get . I like that . Honey , hush . That 's it , fight . Better that way . Take a walk . I said fuck off . Ai n't you gon na scream ? Now I 'm gon na open my fly , and you 're gon na swallow what I give you to swallow . And when you do mine , you gon na swallow Rooster 's . You done broke his nose , so he ought to have somethin ' to show for it . You do n't understand . You do that , I 'll put all eight inches of this steel ii your ear . You little fuck .",1
somerset,"No . No ... it 's just that everything here seems ... so strange . No . I like the house , and this place . That 's what I mean . Strange . Why do you care ? Far away from here . Did the wife confess ? Why always like this ? Only after the fact ... this sudden realization , that if you shoot someone , or stick a knife in them , that person will cease to exist . Yes . Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here . Did their son see it happen ? Since we 're just starting out , I thought we could go to a bar ... sit and talk for awhile . After that , we 'll ... I meant to ask you something , Mills , when we spoke on the phone . I ca n't help wondering ... why here ? All this effort you 've made to get transferred , it 's the first question that pops into my head . You just met me . It 's very simple . You worked a nice , quiet town , but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it . I 've just never seen it done that way before , Detective . Let me tell you how I want this to go . I want you to look , and I want you to listen . Not here . Well , over the next seven days , do me the favor of remembering it . What time did you confirm the death ? Thank you , officer . We 'll need to talk to you again , after we 've looked around . I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into ? Drop it . No one yet . Please be quiet for a while , would you ? What ? What is it ? Is there any blood in it ? Guessing at this point is useless . Still ... two is company here . And , three is certainly a crowd . Detective Mills , go help the officers question the neighbors . Send one of the forensics in on your way out . Thank you , Doctor . No . Good . I made a decision , because I have to consider the integrity of the scene . I ca n't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field . We 'll be spending every waking hour together till I leave . I 'll show you who your friends are , and your enemies . I'll help you cut through the red tape and I will help you `` integrate , '' as the captain puts it . However ... No matter how much you beg or plead ... jerking off is something you 'll have to do for yourself . Is that clear ? I just do n't think we should have that sort of relationship . We 'd start quarreling over insignificant things . Yes , it 's obvious he was a shut-in . Not an enviable life , but , maybe he still deserves a modicum of respect in spite of that . Doctor , are you saying ... this man ate till he burst ? These bruises on the victim 's head ... They could have been caused by a gun . The barrel of a gun ... pressed against the back of his head . Same color and texture . You always have to find one singular thing to focus on . There 's always one thing , and it may be as small as a speck of dust , but you find it and focus ... till it 's an exhausted possibility . But , why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing ? It must have been intentional . Come here . The bruises were caused by the muzzle of a forty-five . So , there was a gun against his head and he was given a choice . Eat , or get your brains blown out . He ate his fill , and was forced to continue eating ... till his body rejected the food . the killer held a bucket under him , and then kept serving . He took his time . The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours . The victim's throat was swollen from the effort , and there was probably a point where he passed out . That 's when killer kicked him in the stomach . Popped him . `` Dear Detectives , Long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light . '' It 's the murderer 's way of announcing himself . There are seven deadly sins . Gluttony , wrath , greed ... ... envy , sloth , pride and lust . Seven . One is gluttony . This is a premeditated puzzle , and it's only the beginning . I 'm declining this case . I want us reassigned . This ca n't be my last duty here . It will go on and on . Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible . Also ... this should n't be his first assignment . It 's too soon for him . Come in . No , I have n't heard . Already . It 's none of my business anymore . I 'm sure everyone 's doing their best . Good . I 'll get a job , maybe on a farm . I 'll work on the house . What are you talking about ? Did you read in the paper today , about the man who was walking his dog ? he was attacked , and his wallet and his watch were taken . And then , while he was still lying unconscious , his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes . It happened four blocks from here . I have no understanding of this place anymore . Really ? Maybe you 're right . Try putting a little elbow grease into it . Sorry , last one . Thanks , George . Evening , gentlemen . All these books , gentlemen ... a world of knowledge at your disposal , and you play poker all night . Thank you . I just might . Let me get out of your way . It 's a package deal . You get the phone with the office . What ? Hello ? Yes , well ... it 's nice to speak to you . Well , I appreciate the thought ... but ... Then , I guess I 'd be delighted . Thank you very much . Yes ... goodbye . I 'm invited to have a late supper at your house . And , I accept . Tonight . Hello . Oh ... um , William . It smells good . I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts . Really ? Well , it 's rare these days ... that kind of commitment . Do n't worry . I do n't wear it at the dinner table . Same here . My future . I guess I wo n't be showing it to him then . I was close once . It just did n't happen . Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me ... disagreeable . Just ask your husband . Too long . What do you think so far ? Well , you can get numb to it pretty quickly . There are things in any city ... The soothing , relaxing , vibrating home . Sorry ... All television does is teach children that it 's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day . What about them ? I read . Remember reading ? I vaguely recall a large , angry man , and someone called Norton . I 'm certain . He was the biggest defense lawyer around . Infamous , actually . A pound of flesh . `` One pound of flesh , no more no less . No cartilage , no bone , but only flesh . This task done ... and he would go free . '' All day Saturday , and all day Sunday . The murderer would want Gould to take his time . To have to sit there and decide . Where do you make the first cut ? There 's a gun in your face ... but , what part of your body is expendable ? He must have left another puzzle piece . This is just to satisfy my curiosity . I'm still leaving town Saturday . And , if it 's a threat . Look at these with fresh eyes . Do n't see what the killer wants you to . Do n't let guide you ... Even if the corpse is right there ... it's almost like looking through it . Editing out the initial shock . Look at the room . He 's preaching . The sins were used in medieval sermons . There were seven cardinal virtues , and then seven deadly sins , created as a learning tool , because they distract from true worship . Did you read them ? Seven Terraces of Purgation . For now , let 's just consider the books as the murderer 's inspiration . The books and sermons are about atonement for sin . And , these murders have been like forced attrition . Attrition . When you regret your sins , but not because you love God . No fingerprints ? Totally unrelated victims . No witnesses of any kind ? In any major city , minding your own business is a perfected science . There 's a public crime prevention course offered at the precinct house once a month . The first thing they teach is that you should never cry `` help . '' Always scream `` fire , '' because people do n't want to get caught up in anything . But a fire ... that 's an evening 's entertainment . They come running . This is the one thing . What if it 's not that she's seen something ? What if she 's supposed to see something , but she just has n't been given a chance to see it yet ? It should be now . There may be something we 're not seeing . You 're sure your men did n't move this ? It 's got to be . He changed the wire to rehang it . A switchblade . There must be something . Bear with me . Just wait ! Call the print lab . No . It does n't fit . He does n't want us to help him stop . You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould , did n't you ? About catching this guy . You really want to believe that , do n't you ? I wish I still thought like you . All we do is pick up the pieces . We take all the evidence , and all the pictures and samples . We write everything down and note what time things happened ... We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away , on the slim chance it 's ever needed in a courtroom . It 's like collecting diamonds on a desert island . You keep them just in case you ever get rescued , but it 's a pretty big ocean out there . I 'm , sorry , but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues . I 've seen so many corpses rolled away ... unrevenged . In this city , if all the skeletons came out of all the closets ... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again , there 'd be no more room for the living . Does n't seem like our man , does it ? He does n't have the desire somehow . Our killer seems to have more purpose . More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of . Yes . They were there ... so , it must be . Why would we ? Never in my twenty-four years , knock on wood . I 've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it . Never fired it though . Not once . You ? And ? How did the fire fight end ? How was it ? I think Hemingway wrote somewhere ... I ca n't remember where , but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this , you have to have the ability to kill . I think he meant you truly must be able to do it , not just faking it , too survive . Jesus ... Victor ? Call an ambulance . The first one ... it 's dated one year ago . To the day . The way this has gone till now , I wouldn't have thought it was possible , but we may have underestimated this guy . Listen to me . He 's all about playing games . We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here . No matter how hard it is , we have to stay focused on the details . He 'll string us along all the way if we're not careful . Are you listening to me ? They pay cops for the inside scoop , and they pay well . Oh , it 's alright . It 's always impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions . There 's no way he 'll survive ? Victor 's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month . He says , quote , `` I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one , and nobody ever complained about him . He 's the best tenant I 've ever had . Who pays the rent on time . This is the job . It 's not an Easter egg hunt . It 's too dismissive to call him a lunatic . We ca n't make that mistake . It 's a fine line between insane and inspired . No . No . He 's not depending on luck . You've seen that . We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed , to the day . To the day ! Because he wanted us to . Yes we do . Here ... This quote ... his first words to us . I looked it up . It 's from Milton 's Paradise Lost . `` Long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light ... `` Well , he 's been right so far , has n't he ? Just , realize ... this is not some common lunatic . The type of intestinal fortitude it must take ... to keep a man bound for a full year . To connect tubes to his genitals . To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints . He 's methodical and exacting , and worst of all , he 's patient . How much money do you have ? I propose a field trip . At the top of the list , we 'll put Purgatory , Canterbury Tales ... anything relating to the seven deadly sins . Now , what the killer might research . What would he need to study to do the things he's done ? What are his other interests ? For example ... They had about fifty health violations during the last inspection . Give me your money . It 's not a problem . Let 's go . By telling you this , I 'm trusting you more than I trust most people . It 's probably nothing , but even if it is , it 's no skin off our teeth . The man at Hot Dog World is a friend , in the Bureau . For a long time , the F.B.I . 's been hooked into the library system , keeping accurate records . They monitor reading habits . Not every book , but certain ones are flagged . Books about ... let 's say , how to build a nuclear bomb , or maybe Mein Kampf . Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I . from then on . Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable ... communism to violent crime . Legal ... illegal . These terms do n't apply . I do n't applaud it . They ca n't use the information directly , but it 's a useful guide . It might sound silly , but you ca n't get a library card without i.d . and a current phone bill . If you want to know who 's been reading Paradise Lost , Purgatory , and say ... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson , the Bureau 's computer will tell you . It might give us a name . Yeah , well ... at least we 're out of the office . We 've got pizza . I do n't . Neither do you . We 're focusing . The Divine Comedy . A History of Catholicism . A book called Murderers and Madmen . It 's not what you think it is . That is . Saint Thomas Aquinas . He wrote about the seven deadly sins . That 's what it says . Jonathan Doe . We 'll take a look at him . Talk to him . You do the talking . Put that old silver tongue of yours to work . Mills ... ! I do n't know . Might 've been a revolver . Brown hat . Tan raincoat ... like a ... like a trench coat . Mills ... Are you alright ? What happened ? Mills ... ? Wait ... just wait . You ca n't go in there . We need a warrant . Think about it ... Think about how we got here ! We ca n't tell anyone about this . We can't tell them about the Bureau , so we have no reason for being here . Think it through . If we leave a hole like this , we 'll never prosecute . He 'll walk . We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door . You stupid son of a ... Have him sign it . Wait outside . Victor . Jesus . What are you talking about ? We could use about fifty more men here . Well , there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room , and near as I can tell , each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages . `` What sick , ridiculous , puppets we are , and what a gross , little stage we dance on . What fun we have , dancing and fucking , not a care in the world . Not knowing that we are nothing . We are not what was intended . '' `` On the subway today , a man came to me to start a conversation . He made small talk , this lonely man , talking about the weather and other things . I tried to be pleasant and accommodating , but my head began to hurt from his banality . I almost didn't notice it had happened , but I suddenly threw up all over him . He was not pleased , and I could n't help laughing . '' No dates indicated , placed on the shelves in no discernible order . It 's just his mind poured out on paper . I do n't think it 's going to give us any specifics . These murders are his masterwork . His sermon to all of us . To all us sinners . Hello . Tracy , is everything alright ? Where 's David ? It 's alright , I guess . I really do n't understand . I just ... I do n't know , with this case . It 's a hard place . I feel strange being here with you ... without David knowing . You have to put blinders on sometimes . Most times . Talk to him about it . He 'll understand if you tell him how you feel . He mentioned it . You should look into private schools . What 's really bothering you ? Oh , Tracy ... I have to tell you , I 'm not the one to talk to about this . If you 're thinking ... I had a relationship once , very much like a marriage . And , she was going to have our child . This is a long time ago . She and I had decided we were going to make the choice together ... whether to keep the baby . Well , I got up one morning and went to work ... just like any other day , except it was my first since hearing about the baby . And , I ... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me . I looked around , and I thought , how can we raise a child surrounded by all this ? How can a child grow up here ? So , that night , I told her I did n't want us to have it , and over the next few weeks , I convinced her it was wrong . I mean ... I wore her down , slowly . I can tell you now , I know ... I 'm positive I made the right decision . I 'm positive . But , there 's never a day that passes that I do n't wish I had decided differently . If you ... do n't keep the baby , if that's what you decide , then , never tell him you were pregnant . I mean that . Never . The relationship will whither and die . But , if you do decide to have the baby , then , at that very moment , when you're absolutely sure , tell David . Tell him at that exact second , and then spoil that kid every chance you get . That 's all the advice I can give you , Tracy . I do n't even know you . What was this job you did for him ? You built this for him ? You build this ? Where was the girl ? Where was the prostitute ? Where was she ? Who tied her down ? You or him ? The irony is , after a day of the type of work he did , he 'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories . Murders in the Rue Morgue . Le Fanu 's Green Tea . My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours . One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book , `` The Century of the Detective , '' by Jurgen Thorwald . It traced the history of deduction as a science , and it sealed my fate , because it was real , not fiction . And , that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime ... it was incredible to me . You know ... there 's not going to be a happy ending to this . It 's not possible anymore . No . Face it now . Stop thinking it 's good guys against bad guys . Do n't try to focus on things as black and white , because you 'll go blind . There 's no winning and losing here . You tell me , then ... you walk into an apartment , and a man has beaten his wife to death , or the wife murdered the husband , and you have to wash the blood off their children . You put the killer in jail . Who won ? Where 's the victory ? Just know that in this case there 's not going to be any satisfaction . If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself , if it turned out he were actually Satan , then , that might live up to our expectations . No human being could do these things , right ? But , this is not the devil . It 's just a man . People do n't want a champion . They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers . It was n't one thing , if that 's what you mean . I just ... I ca n't live here anymore . I ca n't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue . Wrong ! I sympathize completely , because if you ca n't win ... then , if you do n't ignore everything and everyone around you , you ... you become like John Doe . It 's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it , because it takes so much work to love . You just have to make sure you do n't stop to think about the abuse , and the damage , because you 'll risk being sad . Keep ignoring . No I 'm not ! I 'm talking about common , everyday life here . If you let yourself worry about one thing , you 'll worry about the next , and the next , and it never ends . In this place , ignorance is n't just bliss , it 's a matter of survival . That part of me is dead . Sleeping pills . You see what he did ? Call for help , and you 'll live . But , you 'll be disfigured . Or , put yourself out of your misery . I 've decided to stay on this , till it's over . Till it 's either done or we can both see it 's never going to finish . One of two things will happen . We're either going to get John Doe , or he'll finish his series of seven , and this case will go on for years . I 'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days . You 'd be doing me the favor . No , actually , I was n't sure at all . As soon as this is over , I 'm gone . Be careful ! I do n't believe it . Because he is John Doe , by choice . He 's not finished . You and I are , probably for the first time ever , in total agreement . He would n't just stop . He 's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece , right ? Can you even conceive of what 's going to happen next ? I mean , can you even imagine how he 'll try to finish it ? I can tell you this . I recognize his lawyer . His name 's Mark Swarr . He 's the one who got Victor out . We 'll wait for John Doe 's plea . This is all part of his game plan . If he were to claim insanity , this conversation is admissible . The fact that he 's blackmailing us with his plea ... If there really are two more dead . Well ... get the fucking lawyer out of the room and we can talk about how this whole thing 's going to go down . If John Doe 's head splits open and a U.F.O . flies out , I want you to have expected it . I suppose so . If you were man enough to actually file the claim , I 'd buy you a new one out of my own pocket . What is it ? Slut . Give me a break . Stay as cold as ice . Who are you , John ? Who are you really ? I mean , at this point , what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself ? What 's so exciting ? Why ? Mills ! Stay with him . There 's no time to discuss it ! There 's a van ... coming down the industrial road . Coming from the east . The van is coming form the east . I don't know what it is . Come around . Come around . Just get ready for anything and wait for my signal . Wait for me . Stop the van ! Stop ! Get out ! Get out with your hands on your head ! Do it now ! Turn around . Hands on your head ! Who are you ? What are you doing out here ? Put it down . Put it on the ground . Go . Get out of here ! There 's a package here . It 's from John Doe . I do n't know ... I do n't know ... I 'm going to have to open it . Oh , Christ ... oh Christ ... No ... Oh , fuck , no ... Listen ... listen to me . Whatever you do ... do n't come in here . Stay away . No matter what you hear , do not move in ! John Doe has the upper hand . Mills ... put down your gun ! Throw it away ! Throw your gun down now ! Throw your weapon , detective ! Now ! David ... please ... Give me the gun . No ! I ca n't let you do this ... Do n't do this ... please ... David , listen to me ... He wants this ! He wants you to do it ! I ca n't let you do this ! NO ! Hello . I can breathe without pain now , so I guess I feel great . Thank you . Tell them , thank you . Yeah , that 's true . It would be too hard . I read about it in the paper . I 'll see you . Nothing . Oh ... man ...",0

john doe,"I admire you . I do n't know how you found me , but imagine my surprise . I respect you detectives more every day . No , no , no ! You listen . I 'll be back on schedule tomorrow , even with this setback . I just had to call and express my admiration . I 'm sorry I had to hurt you today , but I did n't have a choice . You will accept my apology , wo n't you ? I feel like saying more ... but I do n't want to ruin the surprise . I 've gone and done it again . Detective . Detective ! I know you . Hello . I want to speak to my lawyer . What do you mean ? It does n't matter who I am . Who I am means absolutely nothing . You need to turn left here ... at the traffic light . You 'll see . Wanting people to pay attention , you can't just tap them on the shoulder . You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer . Then , you have their strict attention . Not me . I 'm not special . I 'm not exceptional . This is , though . What I 'm doing . You know that 's not true . You ca n't see the whole ... the whole complete act yet . Not yet . But , when this is done , it 's going to be ... so ... so ... It 's going to be flawless . People will barely be able to comprehend it . It will seem almost surreal ... but it will have a tangible reality , so they wo n't be able to deny it . I ca n't wait for you to see . I can't wait ... It 's really going to be something . Oh , do n't worry . You wo n't ... ... you wo n't miss a thing . It 's not too far away now . I ... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than ... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows . Is n't that true ? How happy would it make you to hurt me , with impunity ? You would n't because you know there are consequences . It 's in those eyes of yours , though ... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work . I wo n't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner . I only took their sins to logical conclusions . Innocent ? Is that supposed to be funny ? Look at the people I killed . An obese man , a disgusting man who could barely stand up ... who if you saw him on the street , you 'd point so your friends could mock him along with you . Who if you saw him while you were eating , you would n't be able to finish your meal . After him I picked the lawyer . And , you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one . This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster ... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets . A woman ... A woman ... so ugly on the inside that she could n't bare to go on living if she could n't be beautiful on the outside . A drug dealer ... a drug dealing pederast , actually . And , do n't forget the disease spreading whore . Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face . That 's the point . You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner , and in every home , literally . And we tolerate it . Because it 's common , it seems trivial , and we tolerate , all day long , morning , noon and night . Not anymore . I 'm setting the example , and it 's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed , from now on . You should be thanking me . You 're going to be remembered , and it 's all because of me . And , the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be . Really ? Just biding your time , then ? Toying with me . Is that it ? Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in ? Tell me what it was that gave me away . What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air . And , I remember breaking your nose . You 're only alive because I didn't kill you . I spared you , and you 're going to have to remember that every time you look in the mirror at that nose on your face for the rest of your life . Or , I should say , for the rest of what life I 've allowed you to have . Do n't ask me to pity the people I killed . I do n't mourn them anymore than I mourn the thousands who died in Sodom and Gomorrah . The Lord works in mysterious ways . I did n't do that . What time is it ? I want to know . It 's close . There he goes . It 's good we have some time to talk . When I said I admired you ... I meant what I said . I do admire you . I wish I could have been a normal man like you . I wish I could have a simple life . You 've made a good life for yourself ... Here he comes . I want you to know , I wish I could have lived like you do . Are you listening to me , Detective Mills ? I 'm trying to tell you how much I admire you ... and your pretty wife Tracy . It 's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct . I visited your home this morning , after you left . I tried to play husband ... tried to taste the life of a simple man , but it didn't work out . So , I took a souvenir . Her pretty head . Because I envy your normal life . Envy is my sin . Kill me . She begged for her life , and for the life of your baby inside her . You did n't know .",1
z,"All my life , I 've lived and worked in the big city ... ... which is kind of a problem , since I 've always felt uncomfortably in crowds . I feel ... isolated . Different . I've got abandonment issues . My father flew away when I was just a larva . My mother did n't have much time for me ... when you have five million siblings , it 's difficult to get attention . I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight . Sometimes I think I 'm just not cut out to be a worker . But I do n't have any other options . I was assigned to trade school when I was just a whole system just ... makes me feel ... ... I should ? Why are we so successful ? ... Ants ... But -- but I 've always felt life was about finding meaning ... and then sharing it with someone special , someone you love . Sorry Azteca . Here you go , fellas ! Fresh dirt ! Alley oop ! Should n't we be wearing gloves ? I mean this dirt is very ... dirty . Does n't anyone think of hygiene ? Boy am I hungry . I 'm so hungry I'm seeing double . It looks like there 's lunch ? Tomorrow , or the day after ? The squeaky wheel gets the oil . Thank goodness . Breaktime . This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground . Why are we even digging this thing ? We declared war again ? Are you scared ? Did you see that ? How he gave the beers , not me ? I 'm telling you , he 's got something against workers . Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers . You soldiers get all the glory . Plus you get to go out into the world , meet interesting insects , and kill them . Weaver , they 're career girls . They 're obsessed with digging . No , I 'll probably never meet the girl for me . I ca n't help it . I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature . Call me crazy . Of course . You were born two seconds after me . Weaver , I 'm an insect , not a liquid . Hey , Weaver , listen ! Hey , did you hear what he said ? ! I 'm not in the mood . Even when they 're off work , they follow orders . What a bunch of losers . Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system -- Me ? ! Just let me finish my beer . So uh -- how come I have n't seen you around here before ? The palace , hunh ? I bet those royals really live it up . Of course they're all a little , you know , from inbreeding -- Now , let 's see , I -- it 's been a while since I -- I think you -- Here , I 'll lead . Well , actually , uh -- I 'm sort of making it up -- Why should everyone dance the same way ? It 's as exciting as watching fungus grow . You -- you think I 'm right ? Oh , that 's okay , I 'll let him off this time . Are you crazy ? This guy 's built like a pebble ! You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays -- Because -- because I 'm an Princess ? You 're a Wait ! When can I see you again ? Wait ! Princess ! Wait ! Are you kidding ? There were sparks between us ! This scarf is a sign ! What 's gon na go wrong ? ! I take your place for the royal inspection . Bala comes strolling down the line , she sees me -- and she takes me up to the palace for a little ... tea and crumpets ... and you take your place again , and go march around to your heart 's content ! You have to help me . Please , Weaver . Think of all the things I 've done for you ! Well I 'm gon na you ... You bet ! They 'll really go for a sensitive guy like you ! You 're a real buddy . What do I do ? Thanks ! I owe you ! Any of you guys know when the Princess will show up ? She 's kind of a personal friend . `` Trapped inside your head '' -- that's a good one -- Geez -- tough room . Lays it on a little thick , doesn't he ? If you ask me , he 's one giant bore . Geez , and I forgot my toothbrush . Bravo ! Bring on the Princess ! Princess ! Princess Bala ! Hey ! It's me ! Z ! I 've got your scarf ! Excuse me , guys -- That 's my date . Well , it 's been fun . Have a great war ! Hey ! Wait ! I just joined up . But I 'm quitting ! I got a trial membership ! Wait a minute , there 's been a mistake ! I 've got to get back to the colony ! Yeah . Well -- no . She 's kind of playing hard to get . As a matter of fact , she 's playing completely unattainable . So , what 's on the schedule ? A brisk walk ? a foraging expedition ? Attack ? But -- I hate attacking ! It 's so hostile ! So -- these termites , they 're little , shy , retiring insects ? Well , what exactly does our platoon do ? Serve beverages ? Process paperwork ? So we 're going back for more armor , right ? I mean , these guys are from outer space , how are we supposed to beat them ? ! Maybe they went out for the evening . Let 's leave them a message and head home . Guys ! Guys ! It is n't too late for all of us to just talk this over ! Wait ! Please ! Acid makes me come out in spots ! -- Could I just say I have always had the greatest respect for your species ? I mean , eating wood -- why did n't I -- BARBATUS ! You -- you saved my life ! Look out ! Excuse me . I seem to be lost , and I was wondering if you could give me -- I 'll let myself out . Shoo ! -- Torro ! Torro ! Hey , I 'm sorry , it was a mistake -- This is terrific ! Let 's exact crippling war reparations ! Let 's set up a puppet government ! Barbatus ? Barbatus ! No , no , you 're ... lookin ' good . You 've got good color in your cheeks . Hang in there , buddy ! You can make it ! Just -- take deep breaths , I'll try and find your body -- it 's got ta be around here somewhere ! Barbatus , hang on -- Barbatus ! ! It was horrible ... a massacre , a massacre upon a massacre . First we massacred them , then they massacred us , then it was halftime . I 've never seen such violence , such bloodthirstiness , such bad manners ... I 'm the only one that made it ! No -- you -- you do n't understand ! Royal victory party ? Will ... will Princess Bala be there ? ONE TO NOTHING ! Well , I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death 's back . So , tell me , fellow war-monger ... do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform ? Engaged ? As in you 're getting married ? So ... you two are in love ? Wow , what a spread -- you know , there 's a food shortage in the rest of the colony . ... Not enough food ? Well I , I do n't think `` living it up '' is the right term -- how about '' working themselves to death '' ? Oh , hey , that 's great , I think I see an old war buddy over there , it's been fun chatting . Good luck with the hallucinations . But ... do n't you think the worker class is the very foundation of the colony -- I mean , uh , without them , who would we stand on ? Well , if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero , yes I am . And you are ... ? Ah , yes . Well , charmed , I 'm sure . So , Princess , have you ever danced with a hero ? Oh ... oh well then , one more won't matter . Just warming up ... Oh , of course -- Uh , sorry , General , I ... I 've always had this animal magnetism , it -- Divinely ? No ... as a matter of fact ... Gee , uh , could you say it a little louder , I think there are some ants in the next colony who did n't hear you . That 's not what you said the -- At the pretty hot to trot then ! Well it was n't a masquerade , really , it was more what I 'd call a clever ruse -- Ca n't we all settle this like adults -- we 're not larvae anymore -- No I 'm not -- I mean -- nobody move ! Or the Princess gets it ! Stay back , you I do n't know how to use this ? Uh-oh . You 're telling me ... How should Alright , alright , I 'll try to get directions from one of the locals . Excuse me , I -- Pardon me -- And they call them social insects . Who 's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped , or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot ? Theoretically , yes . But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it ? But can there be a society composed of just two ants ? Look around , sweetheart . Well I guess that makes us even . Oh come on , after me -- the swarthy , earthy , sensual worker ! Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica ? Well , that 's an appealing offer , but ... considering the options ... You go back . Me , I 'm going to Insectopia . Yeah , well I have it on a reliable source ... that it exists . Now you follow the yellow egg ... I 've got a Water ... water -- oh , you already said that . perfectly happy until I met you -- alright , I was miserable , but I was Come on -- it 's gone ! What are the chances of that happening again ? Well I 'll be . Want a list ? It 's ... it 's ... This lake is huge ! And so close to the colony ! Think of the vacation potential ! Listen , `` Princess '' , you ca n't order me around . Out here , you 're not the boss anymore -- out here , you're just -- Hlllllllp ! Princess , has it ever occurred to you that they 're Look . How many other Princesses are there ? And only you can become a Queen ? So what makes you so special ? Come on ... tell me there was n't just a little ... something between us that first night at the bar . The night we danced . ... The land of red and white ... We 've found it ! all this food ' Let 's dig in ! There 's - there 's some kind of force field ! Hunh ? We 're ants ! I sort of imagined Insectopia a little differently -- Bala , look out ! ! Bala ! I 'll never see her again ... These things always come in twos ... Take me to your leader ! Whoooooooaaaa ! ! ! Bala ! Come back here ! Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Yeah . I 'm here . Yes ? We 're safe ... Who the Forget it . You go ahead , I give up . I ... I do n't know what I was thinking . `` Insectopia '' . There 's only one thing worse than an ant who goes around mindlessly following orders , and that 's an ant who 's mindlessly following orders . ... Insectopia ? Yippeeeeee ! AAAAAGH ! ! ! Yeah , well , I make it a practice not to trust anyone who shoots acid out of their forehead . Charmed . So ... you never did tell me ... what made you come out to the worker bar that night ? Well , `` trouble '' is my middle name . Actually , my middle name is .985 , but I do n't tell people . Hey , Bala , I ... I actually have something of yours ... you left it at the bar that night . Sorry , it 's been through a war , not to mention everything else ... Well , I ... I know it 's a little strange , but ... I thought it might come in handy if I ... needed a scarf someday . Well , to be honest , I just liked having it . Sure . I was n't busy or anything . Great timing , guys . Ever wonder why they call you `` pests '' ? Oh , Bala ? I guess she 's okay , you know , for a princess . I mean , I usually date queens , or you know , empresses , because sometimes the lesser nobility are too much in awe of my smouldering sensuality . Please stop me if I 'm making you feel inadequate . What 's the matter ? This place is as cheery as a Roach Motel at check-out time . She 's been kidnapped ? ! But I can't live without her ! I 'm going back . I 've got to get her . Who 'll come with me ? You ? ! Let 's go , pal ! Wow ... I never saw things this way ... Things look so close together from up here ... there 's the desert ... and the lake ... it 's not far from the colony at all ... Thanks , Chip . How am I going to get in ? The place is crawling with soldiers ! Do n't bite ! I surrender ! Well ... if you insist ... Geez , this place really empties out in August . Where is everybody ? You `` smell '' me ? Well look , I -- I've been out in the wilderness for a while , and -- Hey , wait , you 're ... you 're one of those pheremone sniffers , are n't you ? Maybe you can help me ... I 'm looking for a friend of mine , Princess Bala . Just remember , I met her first . Bala 's through there ? Great . More digging . This is why I left in the first place . Bala ! Why do they have you tied up here ? Bala , that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel 's right underneath it ! -- Formica 's going to said there were too many ants ! I know it 's crazy , but -- I can't just leave . Do n't argue with me . If I 've learned anything , it 's that the problems of two people do n't add up to a hill of ants in this world . Or beans . Something like that . Anyway , I 've Head for the surface , Bala . If I do n't make it , well ... we 'll always have Insectopia . Stoooooop ! Listen up ! We 've all got to get out of here ! This place is going to flood ! You 've got to believe me ! I 'm Z . I Weaver ! Do n't worry about it , pal . To save you all ! Now we 've got to go ! LET 'S MOVE IT ! We 've got to dig a trench around us ! Yeah , but I hate drowning more ! Now That 's it ! Pass the dirt back to the center ! Go on ! Your highness ... time to get your hands dirty ! We need to form a scaffolding around this mound -- let 's DO IT ! Now Okay boys -- take her up ! Wait ... ... I 'm Z . I thought you said that the life of one ant does n't matter . So , uh , that 's pretty much it . Just your basic `` simple worker overthrows the government and winds up with the princess '' kind of a story . You know : there was the big parade and everything ... General Formica was almost unemployable . He eventually got a gig as a honeydew keg . The Queen asked me to take over his job , but I said `` Sorry , but I'm really not the general type . I'm more the specific type . '' So they gave the job to Weaver instead . Weaver cut the defense budget in half . Now we only have an army of five million . And me , I guess you could say that I lived happily ever after . I mean , I 've got the whole package , right ? A great life , a beautiful wife , and a few kids . Well , so nothing 's perfect . But you know ? I would n't change a thing .",0
andy,"It was very bitter . She said she was glad I knew , that she hated all the sneaking around . She said she wanted a divorce in Reno . I told her I would not grant one . If they say so . I really don't remember . I was upset . She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr. Quentin . I went to a few bars first . Later , I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's home and confront them . They were n't there ... so I parked my car in the turnout ... and waited . I 'm not sure . I was confused . Drunk . I think mostly I wanted to scare them . Yes . I did . No . I was sobering up . I realized she was n't worth it . I decided to let her have her quickie divorce . I did not . I got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off . Along the way , I stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River . I feel I 've been very clear on this point . Yes . It does . Yes . It does . Strike me as a fantastic coincidence . It 's the truth . Since I am innocent of this crime , sir , I find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found . Had n't planned on it . What was his name ? I was wondering if anyone knew his name . Hello . I 'm Andy Dufresne . How do you know that ? I did n't , since you ask . What else have you heard ? What do you think ? I understand you 're a man who knows how to get things . I wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer ? You make your customers ' motives a part of your business ? Fair enough . A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long . Looks like a miniature pickaxe , with a small sharp pick on one end , and a blunt hammerhead on the other . It's for rocks . Quartz , sure . And look . Mica . Shale . Silted granite . There 's some graded limestone , from when they cut this place out of the hill . I 'm a rockhound . At least I was , in my old life . I 'd like to be again , on a limited scale . I have no enemies here . Tell me something . Would it help if I explained to them I 'm not homosexual ? Thanks for the advice . If there 's trouble , I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good . You 'll know when you see the rock- hammer . Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop . Ten it is . Oh ? I understand . Thank you , Mr ... ? Red . I 'm Andy . Pleasure doing business with you . You get this in your eyes , it blinds you . Mr. Hadley . Do you trust your wife ? What I mean is , do you think she'd go behind your back ? Try to hamstring you ? Because if you do trust her , there's no reason in the world you can't keep every cent of that money . If you want to keep that money , all of it , just give it to your wife . See , the IRS allows you a one-time- only gift to your spouse . It 's good up to sixty thousand dollars . Tax free . IRS ca n't touch one cent . It 's perfectly legal . Go ask the IRS , they 'll say the same thing . Actually , I feel silly telling you all this . I 'm sure you would have investigated the matter yourself . Of course not . But you will need somebody to set up the tax-free gift , and that 'll cost you . A lawyer , for example ... ... or come to think of it , I suppose I could set it up for you . That would save you some money . I 'll write down the forms you need , you can pick them up , and I'll prepare them for your signature ... nearly free of charge . I 'd only ask three beers apiece for my co-workers , if that seems fair . I think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds . That 's only my opinion . No thanks . I gave up drinking . Chess . Now there 's a game of kings . Civilized ... strategic ... Maybe you 'll let me teach you someday . I 've been thinking of getting a board together . We might do business on a board . But the pieces , I 'd like to carve those myself . One side done in quartz ... the opposing side in limestone . Years I 've got . What I do n't have are the rocks . Pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim . Not yet . I suppose I should . I suppose we are . I 'm innocent , remember ? Just like everybody else here . What are you in for , Red ? Innocent ? I know . I 've seen it three times this month already . Can we talk business ? Rita Hayworth . Can you get her ? Weeks ? They 'd never hear me over that . Let 's get this over with . Anything you put in my mouth , you 're going to lose . Okay . But you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down . Hard . In fact , I understand the bite-reflex is so strong the victim 's jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar . Good evening . `` Watch ye therefore , for ye know not when the master of the house cometh . '' John . Chapter 8 , verse 12 . It 's called a rock blanket . It's for shaping and polishing rocks . Little hobby of mine . It 's very pretty , sir . No , sir . Not especially . Hey , Jake . Where 's Brooks ? I 've been reassigned to you . Brooks ? How long have you been librarian ? In all that time , have you ever had an assistant ? So why now ? Why me ? I see . Well . Why do n't we have a seat and talk it over ? What did you have in mind ? A weekly draw on your pay ? He was right . You do n't want your money in a bank . What 's that gon na earn you ? Two and a half , three percent a year ? We can do a lot better than that . So tell me , Mr. Dekins . Where do you want to send your kids ? Harvard ? Yale ? I would n't say `` friends . '' I 'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning . That 's a wonderful pet to have . Maybe it can do more than that . How about expanding the library ? Get some new books in there . Ask the warden for funds . I see . Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds directly from them . Still , I 'd like to try , with your permission . I 'll send a letter a week . They ca n't ignore me forever . Moresby Prison issued you that gun , but you actually had to pay for it ? See , that 's all deductible . You get to write that off . Say Red , could you hand me a stack of those 1040s ? Brooks , you 're not going to hurt Heywood , we all know that . Even Heywood knows it , right Heywood ? Why ? Ask anyone , they 'll tell you . Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man . You 're not fooling anybody , so just put the damn knife down and stop scaring the shit out of people . Take it easy . You 'll be all right . I just do n't understand what happened in there , that 's all . P.S . Tell Heywood I 'm sorry I put a knife to his throat . No hard feelings . Red ! That 's real pretty , Red . Nice work . What is all this ? `` Dear Mr. Dufresne . In response to your repeated inquiries , the State Senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project ... '' This is two hundred dollars . `` In addition , the Library District has generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and sundries . We trust this will fill your needs . We now consider the matter closed . Please stop sending us letters . Yours truly , the State Comptroller 's Office . '' Only took six years . From now on , I send two letters a week instead of one . They broke the door down before I could take requests . Easiest time I ever did . I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company . Hardly felt the time at all . The music was here ... and here . That 's the one thing they can't confiscate , not ever . That 's the beauty of it . Have n't you ever felt that way about music , Red ? Here 's where it makes most sense . We need it so we do n't forget . That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone . That there 's a small place inside of us they can never lock away , and that place is called hope . Like Brooks did ? You wonder where it went . I wonder where ten years went . Anniversary gift . Open it . Had to go through one of your competitors . Hope you do n't mind . Wanted it to be a surprise . You gon na play something ? ... Stevenson . Next ? Trade skills and hobbies , those go under educational . Stack right behind you . Dumas . You boys 'll like that one . It 's about a prison break . Two deposits , Casco Bank and New England First . Night drop , like always . Very nice . What you hear is n't half of it . He 's got scams you have n't dreamed of . Kickbacks on his kickbacks . There 's a river of dirty money flowing through this place . That 's where I come in . I channel it , funnel it , filter it ... stocks , securities , tax free municipals ... I send that money out into the big world . And when it comes back ... Cleaner . By the time Norton retires , I will have made him a millionaire . I thought you had more faith in me than that . Sure it will . But not to me , and certainly not to the warden . Peter Stevens . The silent , silent partner . He's the guilty one , your Honor . The man with the bank accounts . That's where the filtering process starts . They trace it back , all they're gon na find is him . A phantom . An apparition . Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit . I conjured him out of thin air . He does n't exist ... except on paper . Sure you can , if you know how the system works , and where the cracks are . It 's amazing what you can accomplish by mail . Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate , social security card , driver 's license . They ever track those accounts , they 'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination . It 's funny . On the outside , I was an honest man . Straight as an arrow . I had to come to prison to be a crook . I do n't run the scams , Red , I just process the profits . That 's a fine line , maybe . But I 've also built that library , and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas . Why do you think the warden lets me do all that ? I work cheap . That 's the trade-off . Perhaps it 's time you considered a new profession . What I mean is , you do n't seem to be a very good thief . Maybe you should try something else . Everyone 's innocent in here . Don't you know that ? I do n't waste time on losers , Tommy . That 's a good start . If we do this , we do it all the way . One hundred percent . Nothing half-assed . Well . You 've come to the right place then . `` ... and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor ... and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor , shall be lifted nevermore ! '' That 's right . Well ? May not be as bad as you think . We 'll see how the score comes out . Sir ? I think he 's telling the truth . It would n't matter . With Tommy's testimony , I can get a new trial . They 'd have his last known address . Names of relatives ... Well it 's a chance . is n't it ? How can you be so obtuse ? Obtuse ! Is it deliberate ? The country club will have his old time cards ! W-2s with his name on them ! Look , if it 's the squeeze , don't worry . I 'd never say what goes on in here . I 'd be just as indictable as you for laundering the money ! I was just trying to rest your mind at ease , that 's all . What 's the matter with you ? It 's my chance to get out , do n't you see that ? It 's my life ! Do n't you understand it 's my life ? I 'm done . It stops right now . Get H & R Block to declare your income . My wife used to say I 'm a hard man to know . Like a closed book . Complained about it all the time . She was beautiful . I loved her . But I guess I could n't show it enough . I killed her , Red . I did n't pull the trigger . But I drove her away . That 's why she died . Because of me , the way I am . No . I did n't . Someone else did , and I wound up here . Bad luck , I guess . It floats around . Has to land on somebody . Say a storm comes through . Some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain . The house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat . It was my turn , that 's all . I was in the path of the tornado . I just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has . Think you 'll ever get out of here ? Tell you where I 'd go . Zihuatanejo . Mexico . Little place right on the Pacific . You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific ? They say it has no memory . That 's where I'd like to finish out my life , Red . A warm place with no memory . Open a little hotel right on the beach . Buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new . Take my guests out charter fishing . You know , a place like that , I'd need a man who can get things . You underestimate yourself . Not me . I did n't shoot my wife and I did n't shoot her lover , and whatever mistakes I made I 've paid for and then some . That hotel and that boat ... I do n't think it 's too much to want . To look at the stars just after sunset . Touch the sand . Wade in the water . Feel free . You 're right . It 's down there , and I 'm in here . I guess it comes down to a simple choice , really . Get busy living or get busy dying . Red , if you ever get out of here , do me a favor . There 's this big hayfield up near Buxton . You know where Buxton is ? One in particular . Got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end . Like something out of a Robert Frost poem . It 's where I asked my wife to marry me . We 'd gone for a picnic . We made love under that tree . I asked and she said yes . Promise me , Red . If you ever get out , find that spot . In the base of that wall you 'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield . A piece of black volcanic glass . You 'll find something buried under it I want you to have . You 'll just have to pry up that rock and see . Just about done , sir . Three deposits tonight . Just about done , sir . My name is Peter Stevens . I 've come to close out some accounts . Thank you . I 'm sure I will . Please . Would you add this to your outgoing mail ? Dear Red . If you 're reading this , you 've gotten out . And if you've come this far , maybe you 're willing to come a little further . You remember the name of the town , do n't you ? I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels . I 'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready . Remember , Red . Hope is a good thing , maybe the best of things , and no good thing ever dies . I will be hoping that this letter finds you , and finds you well . Your friend . Andy . You look like a man who knows how to get things .",0
lydia,"Delia hates it . I could live here . scream . It is I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that 's in this food . My whole life is a darkroom ! One ... big ... dark ... room . Yeah , maybe if he 's nice , he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn . I say let 's keep it the way it is . I do . I really like it . I mean , it 's already sort of like somebody 's home , is n't it ? Their couch is comfortable and doesn't stick to your legs . It smells like a real home , not a French whorehouse . I only speak to vertebrates . What happened to the people who used to live here ? Is this the key to the attic ? Any particular kind ? I was just trying to open the door . Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key . But it does n't work . Stepmother . Dad ? I 'm lonely . Nothing . Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw . Fine . Maybe you can relax in a haunted house . But I ca n't . Gross ! How can he stand that woman ? Hey , cut it out ! I 'm a child ! For God sakes ! Sick ! Sexual perversion ! If you 're going to do weird sexual stuff you ought to stay in your bedroom , okay ? Holy cow ! No feet A ... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic ? W ... What do you look like under there ? I 'm not scared of Ralph Lauren . Those are sheets . Are you gross under there ? Are you `` Night of the Living Dead '' under there ? Like all bloody veins and pus ? `` Night of the Living Dead ? '' It's a movie . You 're not gross . Why were you wearing a sheet ? Is this like a trick question ? Of course I can see you . I 'm wearing contacts ... Also I read through the `` Handbook for the Recently Deceased . '' It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual ... I , myself , am strange and unusual . Why are you creeping around Delia 's bedroom ? Stepmother . I 'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles . You ca n't scare her . She's sleeping with Prince Valium tonight . I stole the key to your attic , you know . You did this ? You carved all these little figures and houses and things ? And this used to be your house , I bet . Why do you want to scare everybody ? You do n't know the Deetz 's very well , do you ? My father bought this place . He never walks away from equity . Why don't you leave ? Funeral . God , you guys really are dead What was it like ? The funeral . Did you cry ? God , if this is true this is amazing ! I kinda like it up here . Can I visit you sometimes ? I better go ... Wait a minute , what if this is a dream ? Can you do any tricks to prove I 'm not dreaming ? Well , if you are real ghosts , you better get another routine , those sheets suck ! Dad . Do you believe me ? Stepmother 's ... Well this is ... I mean , this is the weirdest -- This is not a joke ! That sheet was full of ghosts . No feet . You don't believe me . That sheet was full of ghosts . They live here . I told them you were too mean to be afraid . I saw some ghosts . It was n't a joke . By what else ? It 's me . Lydia . They 'd like for you to come downstairs . Delia says you can pick any sheets you want . They do n't want to come down . I think the reason is they were trying to scare you , and you did n't get scared -- The attic . They 're ghosts . They do what they want . Shhhh . They did n't commit suicide . Listen , you guys . These ghosts are really nice people . I think we scared them off . Let 's just leave them alone . Okay ? Come on . Leave their stuff alone . I 'm sorry already . I can not believe this . I can't bring the ghosts . They're not here ! That 's slavery and murder . You do n't know them . They 're nice people ! I hate you ! I thought you were my friends . I hate all of you ! I am alone . I am utterly ... alone . You have sealed my fate with your betrayal . I can no longer stand to be used like a puppet between two deceitful worlds . By the time you read this , I will be gone , having jumped off ... ... having plummeted off the Winter River Bridge . Then you will know that I am no longer a toy in your petty feuds . Goodbye , Lydia . Are you here ? Mr. and Mrs. Maitland ? I 've come for the last time ? Where are you ? Barb ... Of course they 're dead . They're ghosts . Where 'd they go ? Are you a spirit too ? I want to get in . I think so . Well , it ca n't be any worse than my life here . Yeah . I ... I do n't know what your name is . Yes . Two words . First word . Three syllables . Your fingers are so small I can't see them . First word -- two syllables . I do n't know what that signal means . Beetle ! Second word . Be careful . Breakfast ? Orange ? Breakfast beetle ? Beetle ? Beetle fruit ? Fruit bat ? Fruit Battle ? Volkswagen ? Fruit wagon ? I am not ! Beetle ... Juice ? Your name is Beetle Juice ? Yecch ! That 's as bad as Deee lia Deee tz . God , you 're anatomically correct ! You were the snake ! Right ? I know . It was you . No I do n't . I do n't take orders from Smurfs . No , No ... I need to talk to Barbara . Who else did you say is over there ? Okay . Beetle ... J ... He ... Beetle Jui ... He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you . I want to be dead , too . Life is just ... unliveable ... Step ... mother . Really . I do n't know . I really do n't . I 'll go find out . They 're ... not here anymore . No , really ... they said they might come back and all of us could live in peace if you agreed not to tease them or make them do silly tricks . No Wait a minute ! What am I worried about ? Otho , you ca n't even change a tire ! You 'll have to go to the Goodwill . Their wedding clothes . Doo wah . Stop it ! Adam Adam They 're dying .

norton,"This is Mr. Hadley , captain of the guard . I am Mr. Norton , the warden . You are sinners and scum , that's why they sent you to me . Rule number one : no blaspheming . I'll not have the Lord 's name taken in vain in my prison . The other rules you 'll figure out as you go along . Any questions ? Any other questions ? I believe in two things . Discipline and the Bible . Here , you 'll receive both . Put your faith in the Lord . Your ass belongs to me . Welcome to Shawshank . ... the roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing . I need a dozen volunteers for a week 's work . We 're gon na be taking names in this steel bucket here ... Solitary . A week . Make sure he takes his Bible . Add another week for blasphemy . Let 's try the second tier . I 'm pleased to see you reading this . Any favorite passages ? Luke . Chapter 13 , verse 35 . I've always liked that one . But I prefer : `` I am the light of the world . He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life . '' I hear you 're good with numbers . How nice . A man should have a skill . I ca n't say I approve of this ... ... but I suppose exceptions can always be made . I almost forgot . I 'd hate to deprive you of this . Salvation lies within . My wife made that in church group . You like working in the laundry ? Perhaps we can find something more befitting a man of your education . Not a dime . My budget 's stretched thin as it is . Far as them Republican boys in Augusta are concerned , there 's only three ways to spend the taxpayer's hard-earned when it come to prisons . More walls . More bars . More guards . They sure can , but you write your letters if it makes you happy . I'll even mail 'em for you , how 's that ? ... a genuine , progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation . Our inmates , properly supervised , will be put to work outside these walls performing all manner of public service . Cutting pulpwood , repairing bridges and causeways , digging storm drains ... These men can learn the value of an honest day 's labor while providing a valuable service to the community -- and at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. and Mrs. John Q . Taxpayer ! Ned , we 're providing a valuable community service . Ned , I would n't worry too much over this contract . Seems to me I've already got my boys committed elsewhere . You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie . Get my stuff down t'laundry . Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot . Tell 'em if they over- starch my shirts again , they're gon na hear about it from me . How do I look ? Big charity to-do up Portland way . Governor 's gon na be there . Want the rest of that ? Woman can't bake worth shit . Well . I have to say , that 's the most amazing story I ever heard . What amazes me most is you were taken in by it . It 's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you . He hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up . He 's young , not terribly bright . Not surprising he did n't know what a state he 'd put you in . Let 's say for a moment Blatch does exist . You think he 'd just fall to his knees and cry , `` Yes , I did it ! I confess ! By all means , please add a life term to my sentence ! '' That 's assuming Blatch is even still there . Chances are excellent he 'd be released by now . Excellent . What ? What did you call me ? Dufresne , if you want to indulge this fantasy , that 's your business . Do n't make it mine . This meeting's over . Do n't you ever mention money to me again , you sorry son of a bitch ! Not in this office , not anywhere ! Get in here ! Now ! Solitary ! A month ! Tommy , we 've got a situation here . I think you can appreciate that . I tell you , son , this really came along and knocked my wind out . It's got me up nights , that 's the truth . The right decision . Sometimes it's hard to figure out what that is . You understand ? Think hard , Tommy . If I 'm gon na move on this , there ca n't be the least little shred of doubt . I have to know if you what you told Dufresne was the truth . Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury ... having placed your hand on the Good Book and taken an oath before Almighty God Himself ? That 's what I thought . Terrible thing . Man that young , less than a year to go , trying to escape . Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him , truly it did . Nothing stops ! NOTHING ! Or you will do the hardest time there is . No more protection from the guards . I 'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton and put you in with the biggest bull queer I can find . You 'll think you got fucked by a train ! And the library ? Gone ! Sealed off brick by brick ! We'll have us a little book-barbecue in the yard ! They 'll see the flames for miles ! We 'll dance around it like wild Indians ! Do you understand me ? Are you catching my drift ? Lickety-split . I wan na get home . Get my stuff down t'laundry . And shine my shoes . I want 'em lookin' like mirrors . Nice havin ' you back , Andy . Place just was n't the same without you . I want every man on that cellblock questioned ! Start with that friend of his ! Him . What do you mean `` he just wasn't here ? '' Do n't say that to me , Haig ! Do n't say that to me again ! I can see that , Haig ! You think I'm blind ? Is that what you 're saying ? Am I blind , Haig ? What about you ? You blind ? Tell me what this is ! You see Dufresne 's name ? I sure do ! Right there , see ? `` Dufresne . '' He was in his cell at lights out ! Stands to reason he 'd still be here this morning ! I want him found ! Not tomorrow , not after breakfast ! Now ! Well ? I see you two all the time , you're thick as thieves , you are ! He must ' a said something ! Lord ! It 's a miracle ! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind ! Nothin ' left but some damn rocks on the windowsill and that cupcake on the wall ! Let 's ask her ! Maybe she knows ! What say there , Fuzzy- Britches ? Feel like talking ? Guess not . Why should you be different ? It 's a conspiracy ! ( SMASH ) That's what this is ! ( SMASH ) It 's one big damn conspiracy ! ( SMASH ) And everyone 's in on it ! ( SMASH ) Including her ! I do n't care what it smells like ! Never mind , I said ! Just keep going ! Lickety-split . I wan na get home .",1
truman,"Shit ! Why ? What 's there ? Gim me a copy of `` The Sydney Morning Herald '' . Thanks anyway . I want to be an explorer ... like ... okay , okay , let 's call it what it is ... I 'm not gon na lie to you ... life insurance is insurance ... you just got ta ask yourself two questions ... in the event of your death , will anyone experience financial loss ? ... and do you care ? Hold on will ya ? This 's no good . Lumps all drownings together . I need drownings broken down by category . ... just think about what I 've been saying and lem me ... hello ? ... Can you connect me with directory inquiries in Sydney , Australia ? ... er , yes . Do you have a listing for a Lauren Powers ... ... nothing listed ? ... what about a Powers ... nothing ? Thanks ... Not bad . I just won the State Lottery . Tyrone , what if I said I did n't want meatball today ? Not me . You got the wrong man . ... this is n't about insurance , this is about the great variable - when will death occur ? Could be a week , a month , a year . Could happen today ... A sunbather , minding his own business , gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella ... No way you can guard against that kinda thing , no way at all ... Stapleton on Staten Island ? I ca n't do it . No , I ... ... I got an appointment uptown . Let 's go further , daddy ! Let 's go further ! I 'm here to see a Mr Hamilton . When will he be back ?

I got ta get out . See here , this is Queens . All the way round here , Australia . You ca n't get any further away before you start coming back . Y'know , there 're still places in Australia where no human being has ever set foot . It 's not that simple . Takes money , planning . You ca n't just up and go . Oh , I 'm gon na do it , do n't worry about that . I just got ta move slow . Pick a moment . Bonus time 's just around the corner . Soon as I get a retaining wall built on the back of the house I can start thinking about selling up ... and I 'll be gone . Up and away on that big steel bird . I 'm going , do n't you worry about that . Tick-fucking-tock . That 's the fucking problem , Marlon . I 'm thirty-four . I'm older than Jesus Christ . Where do the dreams go , Marlon ? I 'm Where do the dreams You really think it could 've dropped off an airliner ? I ca n't tonight . I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I figure we could scrape together eight thousand . -- We could bum around the world for a year on that . Maybe I like a teenager . Meryl , it 'd be an adventure . That can wait . I want to get away . See some of the world . Explore . Daddy ! ! ... Daddy ! ! ... Daddy ... Hey , stop ! Stop ! ! Two , four , oh , six . Outta the way ! Outta the way ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! No harm done ! No harm done ! He 's lying . Two , four , oh , six was definitely the number . I never believed he was dead . You had to see his face when that wave hit . He was n't scared Marion . It was like he was expecting it , waiting for it . He knew it was coming . You know what was really strange about today ? An old woman with a little dog and a businessman , walking in opposite directions on the sidewalk , both react like clockwork . They force him onto a bus against his will , a bus that does n't normally stop outside my building . And when I 'm giving chase , the bus never makes another stop and I get the feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians are working together to make sure I never catch up with it . You think I imagined it , do n't you ? Maybe you 're right . If only the old woman had n't left her dog behind . It was Dad . I swear . If it was n't him , it was his twin . Can you think of a reason he 'd want to hide from us ? I was seven years old ! I 'm telling you he 's alive ! Fixing the mower . I saw my father on State Street dressed as a homeless man . What do you want ? I got ta go out . About a replacement ... ... mower blade . Hi . Lauren , right ? Look . I was wonder -- I have n't asked you yet . Why , you married ? I 'm not asking you to have my children , just a pizza . How about Saturday ? Friday ? now ? We got finals . I ... I ca n't . Why ? You 've got nothing to be sorry about . Has someone been talking to you ? What are you talking about ? Lauren ! Lauren ! Who ? There 's no one around . How do you know about that ? I do n't understand . Eyes ? Where ? Hey ! Who are Shut your mouth ! Leave her alone ! No ... thank you . Veronica , what do you know for sure ? I 've got something to tell you , Sis . I 'm going to Australia . I have an appointment at , er ... Diamond Enterprises . What 're they doing ? Just tell me what the hell 's going on ? Like fuck ! What 're they doing ? You do n't tell me , I 'll get you investigated ! -- I know . You ever been into the AMT Building ? I 'm going to visit a site . Because I never do . You got a problem with me going ? Let me worry about that . Is there another way ? Ca n't you get around this ? When was the fire ? How come it 's still smoking ? Says here it burnt to the ground . Someone send you to tell me all this ? Small world . You do n't remember ? Two days ago I gave you my meatball sandwich in the park . You were in a wheelchair . Same sneakers . Marlon . I 've got ta talk to you . I 've fallen over something , Marlon . Something to do with my Dad . I think . It 's big , Marlon . You would n't believe who 's in on it . There 's no point trying to show you , they cover their tracks too well . But I 've been going into a lotta strange buildings , seeing a lotta familiar faces , y'know what I mean ? Do it , anyway . I 'm deadly serious . Marlon . We ca n't talk here . I 'm being followed . I do n't know . They look just like regular people . But I 've been writing down numbers - license plates , taxi numbers , ID numbers - the same ones keep cropping up over and over . I do n't know . Could be . One thing 's certain . The key is spontoneity . Be unpredictable . They ca n't stand that . That 's why we 've got to get outta here . Can you come with me ? The beach . This is where it started . Things . Things that do n't fit . Loose threads . False steps . Slips of the tongue . My father did n't want me to see what was over here . Whatever it was , it 's gone now . I never shoulda listened to him that day . I knew it was wrong . There were a hundred people on the beach that day . Everybody knew what was going on except me . Maybe I 've been mistaken for somebody else . A couple of years ago , I tried to get hold of a copy of Time Magazine . The week before an ad said , '' Next Week : Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation '' . A guy with the same name as me in Time Magazine . It ai n't a common name so I looked out for it . But the day it came out , every newstand was sold out . No library had it . I even wrote off for a back-issue . Never seen a copy to this day . Maybe I 'm being set up for something . You ever feel like that , Marlon ? Like your whole life has been building to something ? I 'm a walking coincidence . I ca n't count 'em . No something 's happening , Marlon . I 've got to get to the bottom of it . I 'm scared , Marlon . I 'm as scared as hell . But I 've never felt more alive . It 's just like she said . It does n't matter . She was too beautiful for here . Can you lend me some money ? A hundred bucks . I 'm going away for a while . Maybe you just do n't know me very well . Lem me go to the bathroom . I got a call in the area . What 's the case ? Anything interesting ? Er , yes ... No , no I 'm not . I wan na book a flight to Australia . Sorry , Sydney . Australia . That 's right . You sure you 're not trying to keep me here ? You are a agent , are n't you ? Your job is to help people travel , not keep 'em where they are . Or maybe you 're a different kind of agent , Doris ? Why would n't I ? That 's right . You were expecting me , were n't you ? `` Yours truly ... '' You spell `` truly '' '' l ... y '' or `` That 's what like to know , Lawrence . I was just about to resign . Is n't that a laugh ? I just realized there 's nothing to resign is there ? Why 're you all pretending ? Huh ? What is this a front for ? Why are n't I in on the joke ? Was I away that day ? ! I 'm talking to you ! Who am I ? ! `` Security ! I 'm calling Security '' . You do n't believe a single word you 're saying ! None of you do ! You hear me ? !

See that car way down there ? I bet it 's a Suburu station wagon . I predict the next four cars will be a white Honda Civic , a blue and white Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing , a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender and a motorcycle . There 's the Honda ... the Dodge ... here comes the dented Beetle ... Look , damn you ! Do n't you want to know how I did that ? Maybe you know . Is that it ? Have you been concerned , Meryl ? Nice name . `` Meryl '' . I always liked it . Actress 's name , is n't it ? What 's your name ? Take a break . Meryl I Drop it , I said . It 's over . Shut up ! No . We 're going for a drive . For years I 've been saying I want to go some place , well now I 'm ready to go . Let's just jump in the car and go . I thought maybe , Atlantic City . That 's right . I do , do n't I ? Cos I never have . That 's why you go places , is n't it ? Cos you 're curious . I haven't been curious since I was seven years old , y'know that ? Back then you 'd have to nail me to the floor to keep me in one place . So much traffic , this time of day . Does that strike you as peculiar ? Look at them . You believe they're fighting ? I do n't believe it . Why do n't you him , really make it authentic ? Blocked at every turn . Beautifully synchronized , do n't you agree ? That 's true . We could be stuck here for hours . Could be like this all the way to Atlantic City . You 're right . Let 's go back . I'm sorry . I do n't know what got into me . I 've changed my mind again . What 's Maine like this time of year ? ! I 've never been to Maine . Or let 's just see where the road takes us . I think I 'd like a little company . Look down there , Meryl ! ... No cars ! I don't run into traffic . The traffic follows me around . We 're in a moving pack , do n't you see ? It 's hard to go places , is n't it ? No . There 's no accident . It 'S just more stalling . What 's going on ? Is there any way around ? Why do you want to have a child with me ? You ca n't stand me . Do n't lie to me ! You 're of this , are n't you ? ! No , you 're scaring Meryl ! Stop this now or I kill your leading lady . I know you can hear me . Who are you talking to ? ! No . You said , `` Do something . '' Who were you talking to ? I swear I 'll kill you , if you do n't tell me . How could you buy this damn thing when you know he drowned in front of me ? ! You have any idea what it 's like to drown ? I 'll her ! Right on time . Cops must be telepathic . Damn ! Stay where you are or I 'll kill her ! People know who I am , my every move , complete strangers know my name . Even when there's no one around , I feel the eyes on me . No . No . I 've never seen her before . I know you already think I 'm going out of my mind but I genuinely believe the world revolves around me somehow . Everybody seems to be in on it . That 's just it . I think I somebody . Sometimes I think it 's in my head , sometimes I think it 's for real . Not yet . Fuck you ! Get the hell away ! It 's my life ! I 'm coming to find you Sylvia ! I 'm making myself deaf ! You 're going to have to kill me ! Come on ! Nobody move ! Drive ! Keep talking . Say whatever you say ! Act normal ! Keep filming ! Even the stars I wished on ... You never had a camera in my head . Something real !",0
ripley,"Lucky us . That 's not our system . This is commercial vessel Nostromo . Registration number 180246 . Do you read me . Over . Nothing . It 's not our system . Report to the mess . Turbulence . We 're down . Engine room , what happened . I do n't see anything . We 've still got pressure . Is that it . Get started on 4 panel . I'll be down in five minutes . Fifteen to twenty hours ... Working on it . Yeah . You know the answer to that . Do n't worry , you 'll both get what 's coming to you . You 're guaranteed by law that you 'll get a share ... Now both of you knock it off and get back to work . You ought to be able to handle the rest . If you run into trouble , I 'll be on the bridge . How 's it going . Have you tried putting the transmission through ECIU . I 'll give it a shot . Ash , tell Dallas Mother speculates that the noise is some kind of warning . I 'm going out after them . I still think we should go after them . How many . Dallas , Lambert . Can you read me . Okay . Right here . What happened to Kane . I need a clear definition . If we let it in , the ship could be infected . We 've already broken every rule or quarantine . If we bring an organism on board , we wo n't have a single layer of defense left . I ca n't . If you were in my position you 'd do the same . I read you . The answer is negative . Even if it 's against the law . Let 's call it settled . Somebody fill me in . It does n't make sense . It paralyzes him , puts him into a coma , then keeps him alive . What 's happening . What about Kane . What 's the stain on his lungs . What 's happening . I 've got the toughest job on this ship ... I have to listen to your bullshit . I 'll get off your back when 12 module is fixed . Anything new . What about the Creature . Plenty . What 's it mean . Is that why you let it in . While Dallas and Kane are off the ship , I 'm Senior Officer . You also forgot the science division's basic quarantine law . You just broke it . By breaking quarantine procedure you risk everybody 's life . This is your official position as a science officer . Not exactly out of the manual . The door is closed . It must still be in there . Yeah , I remember . We ca n't grab it . We ca n't kill it ... Yeah . Where 's its mouth . Let 's get rid of it . That thing bled acid . God knows what it 'll do when it 's dead . What about Kane . I need some coffee . How could you leave that kind of decision to him . How does that happen . Since when is that standard procedure . Did you ship out with Ash before . I do n't trust him . They 're pretty much finished now . There are still some thing left to do . We 're blind on B and C decks . Reserve power systems blown ... Is that a good idea . Lock tractor beams . Retract leading struts . Everything holding together down there . Whenever he says anything you say 'right ' . You know that , Brett . What do you think , Parker . Your staff just follows you around and says 'right ' . Like a regular parrot . Yeah . And so will we . Christ . What 's the last thing you can remember . We 're on our way home . What 's wrong . That means we 've got another one . We ca n't go into hypersleep with that thing running loose . We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers . We have to kill it first . We have to catch it and eject it from the ship . First we have to find it . I 've checked on the supplies . For about a week we can stay out of hypersleep . All by yourselves . There 's another problem . How do we find it . There 's no visual communication on B and C decks . All the screens are out . Trap it somehow . I thought I 'd find you here . We 've got an hour ... Look I need some relief . Let me tell you something . You keep staring out there long enough , they 'll be peeling you off the wall . I 'm tired of talking . Give it a try anyway . What 's it key on . Nothing . Hold it . I 've got something . Machine 's screwed up . I can't tell . Needle 's spinning all over the dial . No , just confused . It's coming from below us . Okay . Back this way . I thought you fixed 12 module . Wait . It 's within five meters . God damn it ... hold it . Go get it . We 'll go on . Nothing here . No . At its present size it's holding enough acid to tear a hole in this ship as big as this room . The only plan that 's going to work is the same one we had before . Drive it into an air lock and blow it out into space . The science department should be able to help ... Curious is n't it ... That the Alien is an encephlepod ... It 's curious because lower species ca n't adapt as quickly as higher ones . And this one's doing very well . A real survivor . Might even have as good a chance as we do . All right . What about the temperature . What happens if we change it . That 's what worries me . We did n't get him . I 'll go . Air lock open . Ready . Read you clear . Dallas ... Dallas ... Oh my God . This puts me in command . Unless someone 's got a better idea about dealing with the Alien , we 'll continue with the last plan . How are our weapons . Get it . Any ideas . From you or Mother . You mean to tell me with everything we 've got , we're still powerless against the Beast . I ca n't believe that . Go back to Mother and keep asking questions until you get some better answers . Dallas did n't leave the master computer key with you . No . I know Ash has got the key . He knows I want to check up on him ... Without that key we 've got no access to command priority information . Did you ever sleep with Ash ? No . Ripley . Ca n't hear you ... Repeat ... Parker ... Inner hatch sealed . The outer hatch is open . I do n't know . Take over . You tell me . I guess the alarm went off by itself . Nobody 's accusing you . Go patch him up . How much oxygen have we lost . I want an exact reading . If I could find the command computer key , I could prove it . You think I 'm wrong . Thanks . Let 's find out . Wire him back up . Do it . Ash let it on board . Ash let it grow inside Kane . Ash blew the warning signal . Special Order 937 . That 's what I want to know . What is Special Order 937 . Then there 's not point in talking to you . Pull the plug . Why . Why not tell us . They wanted to investigate the Alien . No matter what happened to us . How do we kill it . How . No way . We 've had enough of your help . Nice try , Ash . Even if you have contempt for it . Sorry Ash . I do n't buy it . He was conning us . He was n't protecting our human lives and that 's all I care about . Anyway it 's done . He 's right about one thing . We 've got less than twelve hours oxygen left . We 're not there yet . I think we should blow up the ship . We leave in the shuttle and then blow up the ship . That 's all the oxygen . Now . Let 's get the food , shut off the engines and get out ... Jones . Where 's Jones . Go look . We do n't want to leave him . I 'll go . You load up the food . Jones . You 're in luck . Come on , Jones . God damn it , Jones . Come here . Here kitty ... come here kitty ... Parker . Lambert . What did it do . I 'll get you out of there ... We 'll get up the autodoc . What can I do . Mother , I 've turned all the cooling units back on . I should reach the frontier in another five weeks . With a little luck the network will pick me up ... This is Ripley , W564502460H , executive officer , last survivor of the commercial starship Nostromo signing off . Come on cat .",0
mills,"Uh , Lieutenant Somerset ? I 'm a little thrown . I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here . Actually , if it 's all the same , I 'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p . Seeing how we do n't have much time for this whole transition thing . I need to start getting the feel of it all , right ? Meet the people . I ... I do n't follow . I 'm here for the same reasons as you , I guess . Or , at least , the same reasons you used to have for being here before ... before you decided to ... quit . Maybe I 'm not understanding the question . Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there . I do n't know . Look , it 'd be great by me if we did n't start right off kicking each other in the balls . But , you 're calling the shots , Lieutenant , so ... however you want it to go . I was n't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell . I 've worked homicide for five and a half years . I realize that . It 's okay . Hold on ... you mean you did n't check for vital signs ? The point is , whenever you find ... And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut . For now . Christ ... somebody phone Guinness . I think we 've got a World 's Record here . Who said this was murder ? Then , why are we wasting our time ? This guy 's heart 's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham . If this is n't a coronary , I do n't know what is . Or not . Still ... he could have tied himself up , to make it look like murder . I saw a guy once ... committed suicide , but wanted to make sure his family could collect the life insurance , right ? When we found him , he was lying there with a knife in his back , so what else could it be but homicide ? Except , I finally figured out ... he held the knife behind him ... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall ... then he shoved his body backwards ... Oh , yes , sir . Forgive me . There 's a bucket here . There 's a bucket . Under the table . It 's vomit . It 's a bucket of vomit . I do n't know . Feel free to look for yourself , okay ? You think it was poison ? There 's room . Light 's the problem . I 'd rather stay on this . You 've seen my files , right ? Seen the things I 've done ? Anyway ... I did my time on door-to-doors , and walking a beat . I did all that shit for a long time . The badge in my pocket says `` detective , '' same as yours . Yeah , well , all I want is ... Just , just do n't be jerking me off . That's all I ask . Do n't jerk me off . Okay ... sure ... It 's just that , with my old partner , you know ... Whatever you say , Detective . Beautiful . Ah , man ... how does somebody let himself go like that ? Look at the blubber . How did the fat fuck ever fit out the door of his apartment ? I can see what you 're pointing at , but ... He died by eating ? Plastic ? Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink ? Near the food ? This does n't make any sense . It could be nothing . Holy shit . This was one sadistic motherfucker . This is his stuff . I 've been out in the cold all day . Whoa , whoa ... what ? ! This is n't my first assignment , dickhead . What the hell ? Give it to me . There 's nothing that says I have to work with him . If Somerset wants out , '' goodbye . '' Give it to me . Can we talk about this in private ? Thank you . ... good . Do it . I 'm going back up . How 's it coming ? Shut the fuck up . Fucking , Dante , goddamn , poetry-writing , faggot motherfucker ... Good work , Officer . Good work . Thank God . Detective Mills here . Honey ... I asked you not to call me here . I 'll call you back ... What ? Why ? Why ? Okay ... okay , hold on . It 's my wife . Well ? How 's that ? I do n't even know if I'm having dinner there tonight . Hi , honey . I 'd like you to meet Somerset . Great ... I 'm , uh , just going to put these things away . Tracy ... what the hell ? Very true . It takes time to settle in . Subway train . This real estate guy ... this miserable fuck , he brought us to see this place a few times . And , first I 'm thinking he 's good , really efficient . But then , I started wondering , why does he keep hurrying us along ? Why will he only show us this place for like five minutes at a time ? Oh , fuck . It 's un-American is what it is . What about sports ? You go to movies at least ? I just have to say , I ca n't respect any man who 's never seen `` Green Acres . '' You've never seen `` The Odd Couple ? '' This is sick . `` The Honeymooners ? ! '' Our guy got into office , probably before the building closed and security tightened up . Gould must have been working late . Well , his body was found Monday night , okay ? But , get this ... the office was closed all day Monday . Which means , as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend , our killer could've gotten in here on Friday . He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould , and all day Sunday . Gould was tied down , nude . The killer left his arms free and handed him a big , sharp butcher 's knife . See ... the scale here . The leather chair was soaked through with sweat . He cut along the side of his stomach . The love handle . Look , I appreciate being able to talk this out , but , uh ... Gould 's wife . She was away on business . If this means she saw anything , I don't know what . We 've questioned her at least five times . We put her in a safe house . Punishing . Like in the Parson 's Tale , and Dante . Yeah . Parts of them . Anyway , in Purgatory , Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain ... seeing all these other guys who sinned ... Right . But there , pride comes first , not gluttony . The sins are in a different order . Forced what ? Like , because someone 's holding a gun on you . Nothing . None . Which I do n't understand . He had to get back out . I know . Okay . But , what ? I 'm sorry about this , Mrs. Gould . I really am . I need you to look at each one carefully ... very carefully . Look for anything that seems strange or out of place . Anything at all . Please , I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this . Anything ... anything missing or different . Are you absolutely certain ? Maybe we better wait . What is it ? What ? Even if they did , those photos were taken before forensics . Nothing . What the fuck is that ? Nothing . Damn it ! The killer did n't paint the fucking thing . Give it up . We 're screwed . He 's fucking with us . Motherfucker ! What ? Oh , yeah , sure . You got to be kidding ? ! Talk to me . Just , honestly ... have you ever seen anything like this ... been involved in anything like this ? He just may be nuts enough . Who the hell knows ? There 's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they do n't want to do . You know ... little voices tell them bad things . And you do n't ? Then , you tell me what you think we're doing . Oh , that 's all . Bullshit . I 've seen the same . I 'm not the country hick you seem to think I am . Do n't tell me you did n't get that rush tonight ... that adrenalin , like we were getting somewhere . And , do n't try to tell me it was because you found something that would play well in a courtroom . Does this make it with you ? You tell me . I 'm new in town . The fingerprints . We 'll tag along . Satisfy our curiosity ? You ever take one ? Never took a bullet . I pulled my gun once . fired it once . It was my first one of these . We were a secondary unit , and I was pretty shaky going in . I was still considered a rookie . We busted the door , looking for this junkie , right ? The geek just opened fire . Another cop was hit in the arm and he went flying ... like in slow motion . I remember riding in the ambulance . His arm was like Jello . A piece of meat . He bled to death right there . I got him . I got the son-of-a-bitch . See , I was doing really good up till then . Lots of street busts . I 've always had this weird luck ... everything always went my way , but this was wild . I got him with one shot ... right between the eyes . Next thing I know , the mayor's pinning a medal on me . Picture in the paper , whole nine yards . I expected it to be bad , you know . I took a human life ... but I slept like a baby that night . I never gave it a second thought . Sounds like he knew what he was talking about . Holy shit . It is Victor . Hey , California , get your people out . Somerset , you ... you better look here . All pictures of Victor tied to the bed . The last one is dated three days ago . What ... ? A urine sample , hair sample ... stool sample . Finger nails ... He laughing at us . I want him bad . I do n't just want to catch him anymore . I want to hurt him . No kidding ! No fucking kidding ! I do n't know about you , but I feed off my emotions . I hear you . What the fuck are you doing here ? That does n't mean anything ! This is a closed crime scene ! Get the fuck out of here ! How do those cockroaches get here so quick ? Sorry about that ... I just ... He has n't said anything , or tried to express himself in any way ? A landlord 's dream tenant : a paralyzed man with no tongue . I 'm sick of sitting around , waiting for him to kill again . There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow . I mean , Christ ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves . Oh , blah , blah , blah . The guy 's insane . Hey , Freud , what brand of bullshit are you shoveling , huh ? Right now he 's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy 's panties , singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter ... Sooner or later his luck 's going to run out . We do n't know for sure ... And so what ? Just because the bastard has a library card , it does n't make him Einstein . What does all that matter anyway ? It 's not our job to figure him out , is it ? All we have to do is catching him . What ? What is it ? I do n't know ... like fifty . Somerset ... what the fuck ? Could you at least sit across from me ? I do n't want people to thing we 're dating . I 'm handing you this , and for some strange reason , I have the idea I should know what the fuck we 're doing . Well , that was money well spent . It 's be best if you got to the point , cause I 'm about ready to punch you in the face . Him ? What ? Assessing fines ? You got to be kidding . How is this legal ? So they ran our list . Yeah . Some college student who 's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime . How do you know all about this ? This is a waste of time . I know , I know ... focusing on one little thing . Modern Homicide Investigation . In Cold Blood . Of Human Bondage . Human Bondage ? The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism . The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu ... Aquin ... You 're sure you 're reading that right ? John Doe ? This is stupid . It 'd be just too easy . Sure . Uh , excuse me ... are you by any chance a serial killer ? Oh , you are ? Well , come with us then , if it 's okay . What are you going to say ? Who told you about my silver tongue ? You been talking to my wife ? This is really lame . Jesus Christ ... What kind of gun was it ? Damn it , Somerset ... what kind of gun ? ! How many bullets ? Fuck ! What 's he look like ? Five ... that 's five ... Second floor ! Second floor ! Get down ! Move ... ! That 's six ... I 'm fine . It was him . The hell I ca n't ! We get in there and we can stop him . We have probable cause now . What the fuck is wrong with you ? By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead . Okay ... okay ... get off . No point in arguing anymore ... Unless you can fix that . How much money do we have left ? So , you called Detective Somerset , right ? And ... I told you the rest . You got it ? Great . Is that it ? Go drink yourself happy . Somerset ! Somerset ... come here ! We had him , damn it . We had him . The pass was a fake . We had him and we let him go . Just put it in circulation . Keep looking . You know , you 're right , I do n't believe you . Keep looking . I 'm trying , alright ? Just tell me what we 've got . Then , he must write about these murders . Looking around ... I 've got a bad feeling these murders are his life 's work . Here ... Hello . Okay , John , let 's ... You were right . He 's preaching . This was definitely him ? Oh ... give me a break . We 've already seen it ! You did n't hear any screams ? Nothing ? You did n't notice when this man walked in with a package under his arm ? ! You did n't notice anything wrong ? Nothing seemed strange to you ? You like what you do for a living ? You like the things you see ? Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps . If we get him , I 'll be happy enough . How can you say that ? Especially after today ? You 're the oldest man I know , Somerset . You do your job ... You follow the law and do the best you can . It 's all there . Why do n't you shut the fuck up for a while ? You bitch and complain ... if I thought like you , I would have slit my wrist already . You think you 're preparing me for the hard times ahead ? You think you 're toughening me up ? Well , you 're not ! You 're quitting , fine ... but I 'm staying . What the fuck is wrong with you ? What burnt you out ? Oh , you 're so much better than everyone , right ? No one 's worthy of you . You 're talking about people who are mentally ill. You 're ... Listen to yourself . You say , `` the problem with people is they do n't care , so I don't care about people . '' But , you 're already here . You 've been here a long time . So , there 's a part of you that knows , even if everything you say is true , none of it matters . You want me to agree with you : `` Yeah , you 're right , Somerset . This is a fucked place . Let 's go live in a fucking log cabin . '' Well , I do n't agree with you . You 're giving up , and it makes me sick , because you 're the best I 've ever seen . Thanks for the beer . I love you . He cut her up and dressed the wounds . Oh , you want to stay now ? You think you 're doing me a big favor by staying ? You knew I 'd say yes . Big surprise . Mills and Somerset are on the premises . Get down . Get down on the floor . Down ! Face on the floor ! Do n't move . Do n't move an inch . What about the trace on his bank account and the guns ? There must be something to connect him with a past . When do we get to question him ? He would n't just turn himself in . It does n't make any sense . He 's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it . You know he 's fucking us . Well ... what the fuck , man ? No . Why us ? How is it working for a scumbag like this ? You proud of yourself ? I 'm in . Let 's finish it . I will . If I were to accidentally cut off one of my nipple , would that be covered by workman's compensation ? Listen , Somerset ... I uh ... Well , I have to tell you ... I think I 've fallen in love with you . Kiss me on the lips . Where we headed ? We 're not just going to pick up two more bodies , are we , Johnny ? That wouldn't be ... shocking enough . Would n't keep you on the front page of the newspapers . What makes you so special that people should pay attention ? I hate to burst your bubble , but other than the fact that you 're especially sadistic , there 's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours . In two months , no one 's going to even remember this happened . Spit it out . Well , I 'll be standing beside you the whole time , so you be sure to let me know when this whole , complete reality thing is done . Would n't want to miss it . Now ... I would n't do something like that , Johnny . I like you . I like you a lot . You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off . That's all . Murderers ? Murderers like you ? Delusions of grandeur . And , why is that ? We would have gotten you eventually . I seem to remember knocking on your door . Sit back . I said , sit back , freak . Sit back and shut your fucking mouth ! You fuck . You really think what you did was God 's good work ? What are you looking for ? Just keep leading the way . Wait ! Get down . Get down on your knees ! Shut up . What the fuck is going on here ? ! Get up . Stand up ! Let 's go ! Shut up ! What the fuck is going on ? What ? What are you talking about ? What happened ? What did you say ? Somerset ... Tell me it 's not true . Put your gun down ! ! Put the gun down , Somerset ! Stop it ! You stay away !",0
deckard,"It was 97 degrees in the city and no hope of improvement . Not bad if you 're a lizard . But two hours earlier I was drinking Acquavit with an Eskimo lady in North East Alaska . That 's a tough change to make . It was so good , I didn't want to leave , so I left a day early . Contact . This is Blade Runner One calling Com-fast 27 . Yah , Gaff . You know where I been . I been on vacation . What 's up ? Bad ? I 'll see you in a minute . I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6 , The Tyrell Corporation 's new pride and joy . Holden was administering the Voight-Kampff test when one nailed him . The Nexus-6 must be fast because Holden was as quick as they come . The report said there were six of them . Three males and three female . Led by a combat model called Roy Batty . They escaped from the colonies two weeks ago . Killed twenty- three people and jumped a shuttle . An aerial patrol found the ship in the desert . No crew . Bryant 's got a liver problem . A couple years back he handed me a bottle and said have a drink for another man . I been drinking for him ever since . Six , huh ? What was he after ? You got a machine on it yet ? Where do we start ? What was the cover on the one that got Holden ? Garbage man ? Did personnel have an address on him ? I 'll go take a look . Thanks . The big incentive to emigrate was still free labor . If the public found out that their door-prizes might kill them , they might not be so hot to go up there . This was one of the worst one 's we had and Bryant was worried . He wanted to tell me to be discrete or something . But I did n't give him a chance . Machines can be helpful sometimes , but they can also be a pain in the ass . Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill . I do n't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it 's their personalities that usually get me . Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image . If that 's true , whoever made Esper should have been shot . You equipped for random questions ? You start . How do I stop one ? Okay , but ... I know all that . I think we 're through for the night . Yes ? Not if it works . The umbrella . Every government that could was racing to populate their colonial territory . But emigrants needed incentive . Over-population and the greenhouse factor did n't seem to be enough ; but owning a human look-a-like had lots of appeal . It was big industry , the competition was stiff and Tyrell was top of the line . His claim to fame was making a product more human than human and sometimes the 'more ' turned out to be a problem . This was n't just an escaped andy who broke his owner's arm -- there were twenty-eight people dead and the pressure was on . But so far they 'd always managed to keep it quiet . Not to say that once in a while there wasn't bad publicity . Some fanatic bitching about equal rights for andies or an occasional trade union proclaiming it was aun-American for automatons to take jobs away from humans on the colony . But what 's more American than good old supply and demand ? The Government needed them , industry made them and the church backed them . The big religious boys said that Androids , no matter how human , were objects ; only God could make people . I 'm not religious , but I was inclined to agree . Otherwise I 'd be out of a job . A humanoid robot is like any other machine , it can be a benefit or a hazard . If it 's a benefit , it's not our problem . It 's artificial ? Why should I be ? You got it wrong , girl . I work with the bureau not for them . My job is n't to detect malfunctioning andies , it 's to eliminate them . The more the better . Thanks . Please . Yes . Go ahead . No . Nothing is infallible , but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof . One that relies on human interpretation . Where 's the subject ? You 're given a calfskin wallet for your birthday . You have a little boy . He shows you his butterfly collection , plus the killing jar . You 're watching T.V . and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist . In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl . You show the picture to your husband . He likes it and hangs it on the wall . The girl is lying on a bearskin rug . Why not ? You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend , and you decide to get an abortion . Why not ? In your opinion . Sounds like you speaks from experience . Last question . You 're watching an old movie . It shows a banquet in progress , the guests are enjoying raw oysters . The entree consists of boiled dog stuffed with rice . The raw oysters are less acceptable to you than a dish of boiled dog . Lights please . If she is , the machine works . Thirteen . She did n't know ? Five , maybe six . No thanks . Discreetly . I work alone . So how did I do ? No rust ? Meaning ? Yeah ? Huh huh . True . Nope . Listen , I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there . They 'll change the limit before I change my mind . Never been more sure of anything in my life . Why did n't you go ? But if you could ? Me too . Thanks . Is there anything else ? I 've already got more help than I need . Sounds like I 'm an ass-hole either way , but the answer is still no . I work alone . So ? That 's okay , I 'll get it ... Yeah . I can imagine . So why do you think they were after their records . Right . Night . The possibilities were infinite . They could change their appearances but not their future . Like she said , it was short . Longevity is what they were after . The garbage man even wanted a past . Poor fuck . I 'd check it out but I knew she was right . The market worked on turn-over . Built-in obsolescence was the name of the game . That meant her too . It was something I did n't want to think about . Yeah . I was just about to have my dinner . What is a conventional term ? Never mind . Do they have that knowledge ? Okay , gim me a run-down on the three females . Next . Number three . Fuck . Taffey Lewis ? Can I come in ? I 'd like you to take a look at these pictures . Do you recognize any of them ? What did she want ? The girl that does n't look like that girl . What night ? What 's suck night ? You talking about the Opera House on the Main ? Book the good ones for where ? What shows ? Excuse me , Miss Salome . I 'd like to have a word with you if I could . I 'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists ... Do n't worry , I 'm not here to make you join -- that 's not my department . I 'm an investigator for the Confidential Committee on Moral Abuses . There 's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place . You have n't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way ? Like to get this position . Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person ? Oh , yeah . You 'd be surprised what goes on around here . I 'd like to check the dressing room if I could . For holes . It that mother real ? It 's a good job . Does it eat ? Sorry . They have their ways of doing their dirty work without the victim knowing what 's going on . You 'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body . Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress . Me . Hmmmmm ? Stop or you 're dead ! Listen , Sergeant ... She was gon na get away . I did n't like her . Yeah . No problem . Gim me another . Forget it . It 's okay . Forget it . I 'll but you one . What 'll you have ? Shot of vodka , please . My pleasure . Prosit . Sorry , do n't have the time . Those cockroaches ? How long you had these guys ? Prosit . No thanks . I like you too . I got ta piss . I think I 'll piss outside . I showed pictures . Somebody recognized her . I went to see . I do n't know . Four years . Like I said , I do n't need your help . I knew a cop once who was involved in a high-speed chase . They shot out one of his tires and he went over a cliff at hundred and fifty miles an hour . They found him in the morning with a broken skull , six fractured ribs and second- degree burns . On the way to the hospital he made a play for the nurse . Hey ! I thought you were supposed to be taking care of me . Do n't just stand there looking at me . It 's not polite . Sit . Gim me your arm . You ever take a bath with a man before ? Fuck you , then . How are you doing , old man ? Well , you do n't have to worry about getting it wrinkled . Sorry . I 'm doing okay . Yeah . But that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . No . I got a problem . I think I 'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes . What 's that ? What about -- not sex -- but love ? These are n't just ... Thanks . You did ? Me and my dad . Dead . I am . Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out . Not too good . If they are smart , they take naps . Yeah . Sometimes . Wishing is a kind of dreaming . Yeah . It was n't very good last night , was it ? What ? Like ? I do n't know . If there is I'd like to find it . Hmmm ? Do n't be fooled by appearances . Because they would ruin the arrangement . I do n't like people snooping around my stuff . Oh no , do n't do that . Never mind the plug , just go through the motions . I do n't like the noise . Just practice . Practice makes perfect . I 'm serious . Go ahead . Show me how you would do it . How about under the couch there . Come on . Good for a smart girl to feel stupid . Part of your education . I never felt better . She 'd never seen the great outdoors . Never even seen books on the subject . She went through everything I had , and we talked . And there were subjects we didn't discuss and they were words we did n't say , I could n't say , like death , like future , like real . But it was hard because she was curious and full of questions . She was more alive than anyone I 'd ever known . You mean a woman ? What 's a long time ? Nope . Nobody could stand me that long . Yeah . Yeah . Who . Got it . Yeah . I got it . Because it 's not . Andies only simulate suffering -- if they 're programmed for it . No , I do n't . Do n't leave here . Do n't open the door , do n't answer the phone . Just wait here . What ? Hello , Roy . She wanted to go to a place I knew . Out of the city . Like one of those pictures she saw . Where there were trees but no buildings . We had a good time . She told me a funny story and I taught her a song . A song about monkeys and elephants . And it made us laugh so hard we could n't sing . I told myself over and over again , if I had n't done it , they would have . I did n't go back to the city , not that city , I did n't want the job . She said the great advantage of being alive was to have a choice . And she chose . And a part of me was almost glad . Not because she was gone but because this way they could never touch her . As for Tyrell -- he was murdered , but he was n't dead . For a long time I wanted to kill him . But what was the point ? There were too many Tyrells . But only one Rachael . Maybe real and unreal could never be separated . The secret never found . But I got as close with her as I 'd ever come to it . She'd stay with me a long time . I guess we made each other real .",0

christof,"You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the road ? They 're pulling out a body . You know you should n't look , but you do . You did well . Old age . Sentiment . You play someone's father all those years , you someone's father ... He sees the way Truman is . He feels responsible . The mask has slipped before . Everything can be explained . What 's dangerous is that he makes the connection between what happened today and the He 's re-created the event on and off for a number of years . We 've never understood what prompts him to indulge the fantasy , or for that matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy to approach her in the first place ... We 'd noticed them making eyes at each other for some weeks but never thought he 'd say anything . She was a year older , wrote poetry , way out of his league ... We knew we were taking a risk . She hadn't been properly coached , but we were torn ... He 'd summoned the courage to make the approach ... We wanted to reward that . Of course she took full advantage ... Why did he say Australia ? Why could n't he have said New Jersey ? We removed all physical trace of her but we could n't erase the memory ... When he decided to go after Sylvia , we were forced to intervene once again ... ... Everybody stay focused ... remember who you are ... Damn ! I ca n't believe how much he 's shoved down . That he sensed the significance at aged seven and clung to it so fiercely . You remember , Moses , it used to end right there , before the expansion . I 'll paper over them . Is that what you have trouble watching ? Perhaps you do n't like watching He 's jumped the rails , Moses , that 's all . We'll get him back on . He 's not ready . You ca n't pull him back in without me . He 's just acting out of character . What happened overnight ? God , that thing of his must be psychic . He did n't masturbate ? Can we contain him long enough ? He believes she has the answer . It 's too late for that . That wo n't satisfy him . He 's going to have to find out for himself . See it with his own eyes . Right now he needs something genuine . Even if we have to fake it . American Life & Accident , Inc. to take effect immediately . Yours tru '' Why do n't we ask him ? How long to take Atlantic City out of mothballs ? Give me a number five gridlock on the Jersey Turnpike . What the hell is wrong with the `` carousel '' ? Keep them together . He 's so close ! It 's tantilizing ! No police . Not yet . We shadow him . We do n't want him to panic . He 's trying to outrun the Keep him on this route . Are we ready ? Did he see it ? No . He 's bluffing . Call his bluff . ... and the last thing I 'd ever do is lie to you ... Thank you . Ratings have never been our primary goal . I imagine we 'll lose those voycurs only interested in witnessing Truman 's latest torment . However I 'm certain our core audience will remain loyal . It has to be the reality . We 've become increasingly frustrated watching actors give us phony emotions , bored with pyrotechnics and special effects . While the world he inhabits is counterfeit , there's nothing fake about Truman himself . No scripts . no cue cards . It 's not always Shakespeare but it 's genuine . That 's how he can support an entire channel . I prefer to think of it as a Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth , he gives us a glimpse of We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort . Have n't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep ? Thank you . I do n't believe so . Not now . He tested his world , as we all do at certain times , and eventually it the test . You have to understand , he is a man made-for-TV , the world he occupies his only frame of reference . No , for him to come even close to the truth is a remarkable testament to his instincts . Working on `` Truman '' has always been a huge commitment for an actor , not just in terms of separation from friends and family , but since Truman essentially drives the plot , it 's a never-ending improvisation . Recent events have raised the pressure but also the prestige . As with our own lives , the only people he can't cast are his family . Otherwise he has final approval , able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend , Marlon , or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player . Who can ? In his entire life , forty-two minutes . A technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of that time . The remainder generally results from blindspots , in the early days , when Truman would stray out of range of our cameras . I believe that to be so . I often feel the only difference between Truman 's life and our own is that his is being more thoroughly documented . We all play our allotted roles -- -- He can leave at any time . If his was more than just a vague ambition , if he were absolutely determined to discover the truth , there 's no way we could prevent him . I think what really distresses you , caller , is that ultimately he the comfort of his `` cell '' -- Do I know you , caller ? Your voice sounds familiar . More than ever . By unwittingly allowing us to witness his struggles , he 's constantly forcing us to evaluate our own lives . He gives us hope . What are you looking for ? Only by two weeks . His eagerness to leave his mother 's womb also meant he was the one selected . The ultimate live television . In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue . It wo n't come to that . I hope we 've got fresh extras . I do n't like the couple with the baby . They 'd never be together . Who 's doing wardrobe ? I keep seeing the same wardrobe ... ... everybody back to One ... ... and , action background ... ... nice ... nice ... I like the woman with the dog ... let 's keep it moving ... I want that traffic kept together ... everybody look like you 've got places to go ... I bet he does n't stop at the newstand . ... Bodycam Two ... ... streetlight eight ... ... ready , Car-Cam One . Go to One ... ... and cut to interior ... ... looser ... ... and action , Vivien ... Looks just like Truman 's mother at that age . Damn , she missed her mark ! Why do we bother with walk-throughs if nobody pays attention ? Give me a two-shot of Truman and Vivien ... go to the master ... hold the elevators ... Vivien , press the elevator button again ... and make sure you catch his eye this time ... Good ! Perfect ! Cut to the interior ... ... and Lawrence ... ... nice look , Lawrence ... and , Vivien ... Regrettably , I have to inform you that Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract . I 'm sure we can all respect her reasons . Her separation from Truman will be orchestrated over the summer . However , I 'm pleased to announce that television 's first on-air conception will still take place . You witnessed the initial contact this morning . You all know Claudia from her work in theatre . Thankfully , Truman does n't . This is a copy of Claudia 's back story . Her character 's name will be Vivien . She 's the new adjuster at the office . We intend to entice Truman into the affair as soon as possible . Claudia will make her advance at the seminar Truman's attending next week . Details are in your schedules . I 'm sure you 'll all make Claudia welcome . I do n't have to tell you , how critical the next few weeks will be . This takes us into the next generation . When Truman's child is born , the network will be switching to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives . There will simply be duplicate coverage . When did he start sleeping like that ? Is that the best shot we can get ? What happened to the room ? I want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's insurance convention . Give me a shot from his wedding band . Why is he so still ? He 's too still . Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify . Give me a preview . An ECU on his torso . Phone him . He did n't drink tonight ? No pills ? Hang up ! Get Marlon over there . Any fucking pretext ! Cut transmission . I said , `` Cut '' ! There . Freeze ... Zoom into the chair ... Enhance . He was n't making a mess . He was engineering a blind spot . All prop cars accounted for ? Why ? We 're getting higher ratings for that graphic than any time in the series . We tell him the truth . We 're making a movie . What have we missed ? No . We 've missed something . Trust that boy ... We 're not watching the sea . Sweep the harbor . Resume transmission . What do we have on that boat ? Fire a warning . Pull back . How long will another chopper take ? We have to stop him for his own good . Turn him back with the elements . He was in front of a live audience . Do n't worry , he 's not willing to risk his life for the truth . His doubts will turn him back . Kill the lights . Keep running ! I take full responsibility . How close ? Capsize him ! Tip him over ! Do it ! What do you mean he 's not there ? We can't have lost him again . Truman ... You wo n't do it , Truman . I 've watched you your whole life .",1
