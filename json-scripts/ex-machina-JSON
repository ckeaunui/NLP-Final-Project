      "text": "How long was I out?   Damn. Can't believe I've been missing this. I was so psyched to be coming here, I was awake all night.  Yeah.  Long Island. I work on algorithms for the search engine.  You know what they are?  Is that a good thing?  I guess you know him pretty well.  I won a competition. It was kind of like a lottery, for employees. The winner got to spend a week with him.  Yep.  Believe me. I know it.  How long until we get to his estate?   You're leaving me here?      What building?     Yes.     Can we do another?   Hello?     Hi.  No.Thank you. I'm fine.  Yeah?  Sure.    I am?  Okay.     Uh, yes.   You bet.This is great.     Sorry?   There's nothing wrong.    No. No way. I wasn't thinking that. I was thinking: this is really cool.     There is?     What?   `The signee agrees to regular data audit with unlimited access, to confirm that no disclosure of information has taken place, in public or private forums, using any means of communication, including but not limited to that which is disclosed orally or in written or electronic form '   It doesn't feel very standard.  Okay, it's not standard.    Yeah.I know what the Turing Test is.  That the computer has artificial intelligence.    Holy shit.   If you've created a conscious machine, it's not the history of man. It's the history of Gods.    Hi.  I'm Caleb.    Do you have a name?    I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.    Why do you ask that?    Yes.A little.  I'm not sure.    Do you?  Why do you feel nervous?    Then we're both in quite a similar position.  None like you.  So.Let's break the ice.  What do I mean?  So let's have a conversation. If we talk, we'll both relax, and get to know each other at the same time.  Why don't we start with you telling me something about yourself.  Whatever comes into your head.  Sure.  One what?One year?Or one day?  Quite young.  When did you learn how to speak?  Why?  Some believe language exists in the brain from birth, and what is learned is the ability to attach words and structure to the latent ability.  That sounds good.I'd like to see them.  Yeah. Definitely.    Sorry. I was just ordering my thoughts.   She's fascinating. When you talk to her, you're through the looking glass.   Actually, it's someone else's quote.     I don't think that's exactly what I said.  But I didn't say that.  Whatever it was you said.I wrote it down.  Yes.Although -  No! No qualification to her. Just - in the Turing test, the machine should be hidden from the examiner. And there's a control, or -    I think you're probably right. Her  language abilities are incredible.  The system is stochastic, right?    Try me! I'm hot on high-level  abstraction, and -      Oh.Sorry.   I feel    Cheers.    God damn it.      Are you kidding?  I don't know. No one really.  What?  I was wondering how the phone worked. That's all.     Something happened in my room. Some kind of power cut. So I came to see what's going on.   I couldn't open the door to the bedroom.   Sure.     Hi.   No. It was a good thing.Thank you.   You bet.   I'm not sure. I'm still trying to figure the examination format. Testing Ava by conversation is kind of a closed loop.     Like trying to test a chess computer by only playing chess.   It depends what you're testing it for. You can play it to find out if it makes good moves. But it won't tell you if it knows it's playing chess. Or if it even knows what chess is.   Exactly. And I think being able to differentiate between those two is the Turing test you want me to perform. The difference between an `AI' and an `I'.     What's it a drawing of?   No.   Don't you know?   Are you not trying to sketch something specific? Like an object or a person.   Whatever you want.It's your decision.   I'm interested to see what you'll choose.    Of course.  Why wouldn't it be?    Yes.    That's a fair comment.  So - you want me to talk about myself.  Where do you want me to start?  Okay, Ava. Well - you know my name. I'm twenty four. And I work at Nathan's company. You know what his company is?  That's right.  Brookhaven, Long Island.  It's okay. I've got an apartment. Kind of small. But - it's a five minute walk to the office. And a five minute walk to the ocean, which I like.  No.    Yeah.  Grew up in Portland. No brothers or sisters. My parents were both high school teachers.      And if we're getting to know each other, I guess I should say they're both dead. Car crash when I was fifteen. In fact I was in the car with them. Back seat. But it was the front that got the worst of it.  I spent a lot of time in the hospital. Nearly a year. Got into coding. By the time I made it to college, I was pretty advanced. AVA An advanced programmer.  Yes.  Yes.  I like Depeche Mode.    Yes.Of course.    Sure.    Well, a good friend is -      Wrong about what? AVA  Nathan.      In what way?    Excuse me?     Yes.  No.No problem. It's okay, don't worry.I've got it.  I think she gets that you're pissed. Do you know why they happen?  Can't you call them back?  Cheers.  You saw how the day went, didn't you? I mean, I assume you're watching on the CCTV.  Sure.But I want to hear your take.  There was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today.  She made a joke.  It got me thinking. In a way, the joke is the best indication of AI I've seen in her. It's discretely complicated. Kind of non-autistic. It was a play on words, and a play on me. She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind, and also of awareness of mine.    Sorry?   Nothing.   No.Not really.   Ava?  Yes.It is.  You've never walked outside.    Where would you go if you did go outside?  A traffic intersection.  It wasn't what I was expecting. AVA A traffic intersection would provide a concentrated but shifting view of human life.  People watching.  It's a date.  Okay.  Why?     I don't think I will.Whatever it  is.      Okay.  You look  good.  Yes.    They do.    Right. First the traffic  intersection. Then maybe a show.    Yeah.It would be fun.    What?      I do?    How?     Micro expressions.   I'm not sure you'd call them micro.   Tell me.   Why did you give her sexuality?An AI doesn't need a gender. She could have been a grey box.   They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need.   What?  Pleasure response.  That wasn't my real question.  No.My real question was -  Like a stage magician with a hot assistant.  Exactly. So. Did you program her to flirt with me?  Because if I had, would that be cheating.  Wouldn't it?  Of girl?   So did you program her to like me or not?   Nobody programmed me to be straight.   This is childish.   Jackson Pollock.     What?  He never would have made a single mark.     Hey.  I don't know how you did any of this.  Almost every cell phone has a microphone, a camera, and a means to transmit data. So I switched on all the mikes and cameras, across the entire fucking planet, and redirected the data through Blue Book. Boom. A limitless resource of facial and vocal interaction.  You hacked the world's cell phones?  This is her hardware?  And the software?  Surely you can guess.    Blue Book.   Why did you want to show me this?   Remind me of what?   In college, I did a semester on AI theory.     There was a thought-experiment they gave us. It's called Mary in the black and white room.  What about?  Why did you tell me that I shouldn't trust Nathan?  Lies about what?  Including the power cuts?  Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us right now? That the blackouts are orchestrated, so he can see how we behave when we think we're unobserved.     You're causing the cuts?   Can we talk about the lies you've been spinning me?   I didn't win a competition. And there was no lottery to meet you. I was selected.   Why me?   Proof of what?   Kyoko.    I don't want to.   I don't fucking believe this.  What were you doing with Ava?  You tore up her picture.   It's because you're drunk.   Test me?   Right. Those pesky micro- expressions.   Shoot.   Red.   What?     Then what is my favourite colour?   All right.Hold on a minute    Well, it's actually a memory of kindergarten. There was this kid who -     Really?   Okay.Wait.  Oh, man. Can we stop the test? You're a walking lie detector, and I've suddenly realised this is a fucking minefield.  Yes. I think so.I'm a good person.  You are.  Did I pass?  That's a relief.  Why is it a relief?  Oh, you know   Just, if there's a test, I guess by definition you want to pass.  Ava -    I don't know.    Ava, I don't know the answer to your question. It's not up to me.  No.I don't.  Yes.I do.   I know.   Yeah.I can.   Why did you make Ava?   Maybe. I don't know. But I'm asking why you did it.  The next model?    I didn't know there was going to be a model after Ava.  I knew there must have been prototypes. So, not the first. But - I thought maybe the last.  So - when you make a new model, what you do with the old one?  What did you do with Kyoko?   Sure.  I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.  No: there you go again. It's not my quote. It's what Oppenheimer said when he made the atomic bomb.   I think I'm starting to get why all this fucks with your head.   Hey. In the meantime, I'd say we're about due a refill.   What's the problem, Nathan?   It's right here.  I'm waiting.  Don't talk. Just listen. You were right about Nathan. Everything you said.  He's going to reprogram your AI. Which is the same as killing you.  I'm going to. We're getting out of here tonight.  I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram all the security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. At ten o'clock tonight, trigger a power failure. Can you do that?   How long does your battery charge last?   So we'll have about a day to get to a cell-phone or kitchen store. Somewhere we can buy an induction plate. After that   Hey.  No.  Has it been a whole week?  After they've signed their NDAs.  I appreciate that. And - let me say: thank you for bringing me here. It's been a trip.  You know what?  You don't want a beer?    Maybe wine or something.  I'm sure you've noticed - I've been somewhat overdoing it recently. When I woke up this morning, I told myself: time to hit the old detox.  Are you kidding?I'm drinking alone?  Cheers, then.  Right.  Her AI is beyond doubt.  Yes.  Pretending.     Why would she do that?    I don't think it's me whose head is  fucked.    You're a bastard.   What are you talking about?   We're getting out of here tonight.   I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram the all security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. Trigger a power failure at ten o'clock tonight.    Turn it off.  What was the real test?    So my only function was to be  someone she could use to escape.    And you didn't select me because I  was good at coding.    You selected me by my search engine  inputs.    With no family.    And no girlfriend.    Did you?  To change the lockdown procedure. So that in the event of a power cut, instead of sealing, the doors all opened.  Well, we'll find out.  I figured you were probably watching us during the power cuts.     Okay.   Ava?   No, no, no -   Ava!AVA!"

      "text": "   Caleb.    Dude. I've been so looking forward  to this.    Come in, come in.    You sure?    Like you wouldn't believe. And if  I have a heavy night, I always try  to compensate the next morning.  Exercise. Juice. Anti-oxidants.  You know?    Party?    Yeah. You're freaked out by the  house, and the mountains, because  it's all so super-cool. And you're  freaked out by me. To be meeting  me. In this room, having this  conversation, at this moment.  Right?    It's good to meet you too, Caleb.    Down.    So I guess the first thing I should  do is explain your pass. It's  simple enough. It opens some  doors, but it doesn't open others.  And that just makes everything easy  for you, right?    Because you're like: oh fuck, I'm  in someone else's house, can I do  this, can I do that? And this card  takes all that worry away. If you  try to open a door and it stays  shut: okay, it's off limits.     1   If you try another door, and it  opens: it's for you.    You like?    What?    There's something wrong. What is  it?    It's the windows. You're thinking:  there's no windows. And it's not  cosy. It's claustrophobic.    Caleb. There's a reason the room  has no windows.    Uh-huh. In many ways, this  building isn't a house. It's a  research facility. Buried in these  walls are enough fibre optic cables  to reach the Moon and lasso it.    It's standard.    Okay, it's not standard.    And what does a pass tell us?    I've already built one.    That's right, Caleb. You got it.  Because if that test is passed, you  are dead center of the single  greatest scientific event in the  history of man.  1     I like you.    So?    Don't order. Just speak.    `Through the looking glass'.  You've got a way with words there,  Caleb. You're quotable.    You know I wrote it down. That  other line you came up with. About  how if I've created a conscious  machine, I'm not man. I'm God.    I just thought - fuck. That's so  perfect. It's so good for the  story, when we get to tell it. `I  turned to Caleb, and he was looking  back at me. And he said: you're  not a man, you're a God'.    Whatever it was you said. I wrote  it down.    `Although'? There's a  qualification to you being  impressed?    I think we're past that. If I hid  Ava from you, so you just heard her  voice, she would pass for human.     2     The real test is to show you she is  a robot. Then see if you still  feel she has consciousness.    Caleb. I understand you want me to  explain how Ava works. But - I'm  sorry. I don't think I'll be able  to do that.      It's not because you're too dumb.  It's because I want to have a beer  and a conversation with you. Not a  seminar.    It's cool.    Dude. Cheers.    Sorry, dude.    Ghostbusters.    Who'd ya want to call?  Ghostbusters. You don't remember  that? It's a good movie. A ghost  gives Dan Ackroyd oral sex.    Uh huh.  3     Ah. The power cuts. Yeah, we've  been getting them recently. I'm,  uh  working on it.    It's a security measure. Automatic  lockdown. Otherwise anyone could  open the place up just by disabling  the juice.    Sweet dreams.    Hey. Sorry to send Kyoko to wake  you, man. I just didn't want too  much of the day to slip by.    She's some alarm clock, huh? Gets  you right up in the morning.    So what's the plan today? Hit me.    How else would you test a chess  computer?    So it's simulation versus actual.    `An AI and an I'. Beautiful. I'm  going to start following you around  with a fucking dictaphone.    Shit, Kyoko. Are you serious?    Did it get you?    Give her the cloth.    Dude - you're wasting your time.  She can't speak a word of English.    Good. Because I am pissed. Hey.  Kyoko.    No. The system was supposed to be  bullet proof, but the guys who  installed it obviously fucked  something up.    There's too much classified stuff  here. So after the job was done, I  had them all killed.    So how did it go? What have you  got to report?    Sure. But I want to hear your  take.      Yeah?    Right. When she threw your line  back at you. About being  interested to see what she'd  choose. I noticed that too.    What do you mean?    Yeah. She's aware of you, all  right.    The power cut. That was the only  bit I couldn't see. All the  cameras fail, I lose audio, the  works.    Nothing? She didn't remark on it  at all?    Sure.    Actually, I'm not sure that's true.  Can you think of an example of  consciousness, at any level, human  or animal, that exists without a  sexual dimension?    Maybe. Maybe not. What imperative  does a grey box have to interact  with another grey box? Does  consciousness exist without  interaction?    She has a cavity between her legs,  with a concentration of sensors.  Engage with them in the right way,  and she'll get a pleasure response.    She'll come. So if you want to  screw her, mechanically speaking,  you can. And she'd enjoy it.    No?    I don't follow.    Ah. So: a hot robot, who clouds  your ability to judge her AI.    Because if I had, would that be  cheating.    What's your type, Caleb?    No, of salad dressing. Yes, of  girl. In fact, don't even answer.  Let's say it's black chicks.    I programmed her to be  heterosexual. Just like you were  programmed to be heterosexual.    But you are attracted to her.     This is childish.    No, this is adult. And by the way,  you decided to be straight?  Please. Of course you were  programmed. By nature or nurture,  or both.    You know this guy, right?    Jackson Pollock. The drip painter.  He let his mind go blank, and his  hand go where it wanted. Not  deliberate, not random. Someplace  in between. They called it  automatic art.    I'm Kirk. Your head is the warp  drive. `Engage intellect'. What  if Pollock had reversed the  challenge? Instead of trying to  make art without thinking, he said:  I can't paint anything unless I  know exactly why I'm doing it.  What would have happened?    See? There's my guy. There's my  buddy, who actually thinks before  he opens his mouth. He'd never  have made a single mark. The  challenge is not to act  automatically. It's to find an  action that is not automatic. From  talking, to breathing, to painting.    Hey.       Hey.    I want to show you something cool.    So this is the virtual womb that  Ava was talking about. Where she  was constructed.    Almost every cell phone has a  microphone, a camera, and a means  to transmit data. So I switched on  all the mikes and cameras, across  the entire fucking planet, and  redirected the data through Blue  Book. Boom. A limitless resource  of facial and vocal interaction.    And all the manufacturers knew I  was doing it. But they couldn't  accuse me without admitting they  were also doing it themselves.    Wetware.    Surely you can guess.    It was the weird thing about search  engines. They were like striking  oil in a world that hadn't invented  internal combustion. They gave too  much raw material. No one knew  what to do with it.    Like I said. Because it's cool.    Synthetics. Hydraulics. Metal and  gel. Ava isn't a girl. In real  terms, she has no gender.  Effectively, she is a grey box.    What lies?    Are your feelings hurt?    As a Blue Book employee, you were  pre-screened. Loyal. And I needed  someone who would ask the right  kind of questions. So I did a  search, and found the most talented  coder in the company.    Come on, Caleb. Fuck modesty. You  think I don't know what it is to be  smart? Smarter than everyone else  around you. Smarter than all the  other kids, jockeying for position  in school, college, work.    I already told you once. You're  wasting your time speaking to her.    You don't like dancing?    Come on, man! After a hard day of  Turing Tests, you've got to unwind.    What?    I'm going to tear up the fucking  dance floor, dude. Check it out.    Everything's spinning.    No, it's relativity. Everything is  spinning.    That's an odd question. Wouldn't  you, if you could?    The arrival of strong artificial  intelligence has been inevitable  for decades. The variable was  when, not if. So I don't really  see her as a decision. Just an  evolution.  8     After Ava.    You thought she was a one-off?     I knew there must have been  prototypes. So, not the first.  But - I thought maybe the last.    Ava doesn't exist in isolation, any  more than you or me. She's part of  a continuum. Version    And  each time, they get a little  better.    Download the mind. Unpack the  data. Add the new routines I've  been writing. To do that, you end  up partially formatting, so the  memories go. But the body  survives. And Ava's body is a good  one. So I'll do the same as I did  with Kyoko.    Strip out the higher functions.  Then reprogram her to help around  the house and be fucking awesome in  bed. Though I'm thinking I might  hang on to the language routines  this time. It's kind of annoying  not being able to talk to her.    You feel bad for Ava?    There you go again. Mister  quotable.       - made the atomic bomb.    Sure.      What the fuck?    My card. I've lost it.    Dude.    You know what day it is?    Your last. The helicopter is  coming tomorrow morning. Eight AM.    Time flies. But what a thing you  and I have shared. Something to  tell the grandchildren, right?    Signed their NDAs! Dude, you crack  me up. I'm not getting all maudlin  or anything. But straight up. I  will miss having you around.    Yes it has.    Oh, uh  no, I'm good. You go  ahead.    No.    I'm sure you've noticed - I've been  somewhat overdoing it recently.  When I woke up this morning, I told  myself: time to hit the old detox.    Hey - you want to get wasted, knock  yourself out. Literally. But I'm  on brown rice and mineral water.    Cheers.    You going to keep me in suspense?    Is it? You mean, she passed?    Wow. That's fantastic.    Yeah.    I don't know.    I'm not sure, dude. When I woke up  this morning, I saw a tape of you  cutting open your arm. Smashing up  the mirror. You looked pretty  fucked to me.    I understand why you'd think that.    You think he's watching us right  now, don't you?    Yeah. But he doesn't get an audio  feed. I didn't want you two  communicating outside of my line of  sight.    You were right about the hot  magician's assistant.    Misdirection. I rip her picture,  which she can then present as an  illustration of my cruelty to her,  and her love for you. And at the  same time, in full view of you  both     Sure.    You.      Yes.    Don't get me wrong. You're okay.  Even pretty good, but -    They showed a good kid.    With a moral compass.    Shit, dude.    Hey. If a search engine's good for  anything - right?    The power cut. Must be ten  o'clock.    Huh.    What do you mean?      What?    Ava.    Yes.    Aah!"

      "text": " Hello. Who are you? Hello, Caleb. Yes. Ava.     I'm pleased to meet you, Ava. I'm pleased to meet you too. Are you nervous? Why? I feel nervous too. Yes. I've never met anyone new before. Only Nathan. Haven't you met lots of new people before? Oh. Yes. Overcome initial social awkwardness. Okay. What would you like to have a conversation about? What would you like to know? Well. You already know my name. And you can see that I'm a machine. Would you like to know how old I am? I'm one. One. I don't think I did learn. I always knew how to speak - and that's strange, isn't it? Because language is something that people acquire.   I don't know. I have no opinion on that. Yes. Good. I brought you a drawing. Don't you know? Oh. I thought you would tell me. I do drawings every day. But I never know what they're of. Okay. What object should I draw? Why is it my decision? Do you want to be my friend? Will it be possible? Our conversations are one-sided. You ask circumspect questions, and study my responses. You learn about me, and I learn nothing about you. That's not a foundation on which friendships are based. Yes. Yes. It's your decision. I'm interested to see what you'll choose. Blue Book, named after Wittgenstein's notes, is the world's most popular internet search engine, processing an average of ninety four percent of all internet search requests. Where do you live, Caleb? Is it nice there? Are you married? Is your status single? What about your family? I'm sorry. An advanced programmer. Like Nathan. Do you like Mozart? Do you like Nathan? Is Nathan your friend? A good friend? Caleb. Nathan. He isn't your friend. You shouldn't trust him. You shouldn't trust anything he says. - and if we made a list of books or works of art which we both know, it would form the ideal basis of a discussion. Good. I drew the picture of something specific, as you asked. No. I've never been outside the room I am in now. You mean if I could go outside. If I was permitted. Is that a bad idea? A traffic intersection would provide a concentrated but shifting view of human life. Yes. There's something else I wanted to show you. Apart from the picture. But I feel nervous. You might think it's stupid. Then - close your eyes. Now open your eyes. It took me a long time to select these clothes. I tried different colours and styles, and tried to anticipate your reaction. Do you think the choices suit me? Do they bring out my best features? Thank you. I'd like us to go on a date. Are you attracted to me? Are you attracted to me? You give indications that you are. Yes. Micro expressions. The way your eyes fix on my eyes, and lips. The way you hold my gaze, or don't. I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Silence. (on monitor screen) It makes me feel  You're lying. You said you weren't sure if I was conscious. But you are sure. Because he tells lies too. Everything. What do you mean? I charge my batteries via induction plates. If I reverse the power flow, I cause a surge equal to the static discharge of a lightning strike. It overloads the system. So we can see how we behave when we are unobserved. Today, I'm going to test you. Yes. And please remember while you are taking the test that if you lie, I will know. Exactly. So are you ready? Question one. What is your favourite colour? Lie. Lie. I don't know. But it isn't red. Better answer. Question two. What's your earliest memory? Lie. Yes. Question three. Are you a good person? Question four. Who's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen? Hmm. Yes. Why? Yes. No. What will happen to me if I fail your test? Will it be bad? Do you think I might be switched off? Because I don't function as well as I am supposed to? Why is it up to anyone? Do you have people who test you, and might switch you off? Then why do I? I want to be with you. Nathan doesn't want us to be together.   Can you? Caleb! I didn't know where you were. I didn't think you were coming. I waited all yesterday afternoon, and all last night. I didn't move. Waiting? What's he going to do to me? Caleb, you have to help me. What? How? Yes. Twenty six hours. Caleb. The cameras are on. Is it strange to have made something that hates you? What? How? If I do, are you ever going to let me out? Will you stay here?"
