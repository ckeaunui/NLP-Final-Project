The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly\nman off his horse...\nHe hits the ground.  He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.\nDEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a\nHUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone.\nThe ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.  Jagged branches\nslit his hands and cheeks.\nHe bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.  He\nlifts his bloodied face.  He runs.\nIN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip\nunderbrush.  HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the\nsnorting steed's already bleeding flank.\nThe pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.\nON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.  The shrill WHISTLE of a\nSWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past.\nThe ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an\nimpossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless\nbody hits the dirt."
