She holds it up ~ OVER HER SHOULDER, we see hearts\nand glitter surrounding and \"Good Luck Tonight!\" and \"Elle\nand Warner forever!.\"\nShe carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across\nthe hall, into the room of --\nTHREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS, who stop practicing their pom-pom\nroutine to sign the card. As they finish, we follow the Card\nGirl out and into the room of --\nA BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a\nStairmaster as \"General Hospital\" plays on a tiny TV. She\nsigns the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, to\nthe room of--\nA BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long\nenough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her\nneck. She hands the card back and we head into the room of --\nA BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a\nglass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE\nGIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being\nsigned, as the drinks go the other.\nOnce the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we\nfollow her out of the room and down the hall until she\nreaches the very last and biggest door --\nShe puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides\nthe card under the door."
