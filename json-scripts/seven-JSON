He halts, turns to one wall where the current\nwallpaper is torn away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.\nSomerset goes to this wall and runs his finger across one of the\npale, red roses which decorates the older paper.  He pushes the\ngrime away, brings the rose out more clearly.\nHe reaches into his suit pocket and takes out a switchblade.  He\nflips the thin, lethal blade free.  Working deliberately,\ndelicately, Somerset cuts a square around the rose, then peels\nthe square of dry wallpaper away from the wall.  He studies it in\nhis hand."
