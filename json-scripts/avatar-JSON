He feels the\nwind of time blowing through him as --\nREAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while --\nINSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora --\n--but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that\nare BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight.\nA great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the\ndevastated ground.

It lets out an almighty SHRIEK\nwhich seems to echo to eternity and --\nSLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body.\nHe weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room."
