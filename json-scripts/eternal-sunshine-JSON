      "text": "   Hi, Cindy. Joel. Listen, I'm not   feeling well this morning. No. Food   poisoning, I think. Sorry it took me   so long to call in, but I've been   vomiting.    January 13th, 2006. Today I skipped   work and took the train out to   Montauk.     It's cold.     The sky is gray.     I don't know what else to say. Nothing   happens. Nothing changes. I saw Naomi   last night. We had sex. It was weird   to fall into our old familiar sex   life so easily. Like no time has   passed. After two years apart suddenly   we're talking about getting together   again. I guess that's good.    If I'm constitutionally incapable of   making eye-contact with a woman I   don't know. I guess I'd better get   back to Naomi.    I'm sorry.    Why what?    No, I didn't know if you were talking   to me, so...       Well, I didn't want to assume.    Anyway. Sorry. Hi.    No, I mean, I don't know. I can't   really think of much to say probably.    I mean, it's okay if you want to sit   down here. I didn't mean to --    It's okay, really.    Rockville Center.    The weirder part is I think actually   I recognize you. I thought that   earlier in the diner. That's why I   was looking at you. You work at   Borders, right?    Really? Because --    -- because I go there all the time.   I don't think I ever saw you before.    I don't have one.    I noticed your hair. I guess it made   an impression on me, that's why I   was pretty sure I recognized you.    I like it.    Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --    I can't remember.    I don't really know how --    You think that could possibly be a   full time job? How many hair colors   could there be?    I'm sure you would.    You sure? That doesn't sound --    Oh, I doubt that's the case.    Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.    I'm Joel.    I don't know any jokes about your   name.    I don't know what that means.    I'm not nuts.    Sorry. It's a pretty name, though.   It means  merciful , right?    See, I wouldn't think that about   you.    Oh. I don't know. I was just... I   don't know. I was... You seemed nice,   so --    Well, anyway... Sorry.    Okay.    Yes?    That's okay.    It's no problem. Anyway, I have some   stuff I need to --    (pulling journal from   briefcase)  Probably see you at the book store.    Hi. I could give you a ride if you   need.    You're sure? It's cold.    It's okay.    Where do you live?    Well, I probably wouldn't say if I   were, but no.    I'm not a stalker.    Yeah.    It's okay. I didn't think you were.    I like to read.    Yeah? I can't remember that album   very well. I remember liking it. But --    Sort of, um...    What?    Well, I wouldn't want to be --    Take care.    Um --    Very much.    Thanks. That was good, that crow   sound.    I don't know.    Frost?    It's pretty.    Cheers.    I'm fine.    No, I'm okay for now.    What do you want to hear?    You just say. I'm not really --    Well, I should probably get going.    No. I --    Thanks.    Yeah?    I don't know.    Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to   know.    Yeah, I guess.    Sorry. My life isn't that interesting.   I go to work. I go home. I don't   know what to say.    I think about that.    I do have a tendency to use that   word too much.    Thanks.    Yeah.    Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --    Yeah.    No.    No, not at all.    Oh, yeah.    That's scary sounding.    I think so.    Okay.       Sounds good. But right now I should   go.    I have to get up early in the morning   tomorrow, so...    Yes.    I don't think your personality comes   out of a tube. I think the hair is   just... a pretty topping.       So, I enjoyed meeting you.    Yeah.    Tomorrow?    Okay.    It was snowing.    The driver waved. So casual, friendly.    I might be making a mistake.    Fuck you, Clementine.    Pink.     There was a number on it. I remember.   AL 1718?     I have to follow through with this.   I have no choice.    We're sorry, the number you have   dialed...     Screw you, Clementine, for doing   this ...    Bye.    It's them.    Fuck.    I should maybe talk to you.    I love you and if you knew that...   if I told you what happened... I'll   explain everything, what we meant to   each other. I'll tell you everything   about our time together. You'll know   everything again and...    Clementine.    How could she have done this to me?   How could anyone do this to anyone?    What's happening here?  (looks at watch; it's   9:30)  Oh, God! I have to go home. They'll   be there soon.    Gotta get home. How could she do   this to me? How could she not care   about what we meant to each other.   What a fuck! What a fucking monster   she is!    Them.    How exactly is this going to work   tonight?    Is there any sort of risk of brain   damage?    It's happening now! I'm already in   my brain.    But you're tracing and erasing now.   It's already started. I'm home in my   bed.    My name is Joel Barish. I have an   appointment.    Not great.    Well... I did.    (thinks, then:)  It was a mess. I don't know how it   got this way...    So then she just stops calling.    Any messages, Carmen?    Any messages for me, Carmen.    Sorry, Carmen. Any messages?    Why would she do that?    She's punishing me for being honest.   I should just go to her house.    Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate.    I don't know. I'm so... I can't   believe she'd be so goddamn immature!    They can't erase memories. It's a   joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.    It's three.    I can't believe you wrecked my car.   You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.    Well it is pathetic. And fucking   irresponsible. You could've killed   somebody.    I don't know, maybe you did kill   somebody.    And what are you like? A wino?    No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked   someone tonight. Isn't that how you   get people to like you?    I'm sorry. Okay. I didn't mean that.   I just... I was just... pissed, I   guess.    Let me drive you home.    Look at it out here. It's falling   apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.    You did it to me. I can't believe   you did this to me. By morning you'll   be gone. Ha!    That must be the guy I saw you with.    Where are you going?    Oh shit. I remember this.     Want to go?    Let's talk about it later.    I don't think we're ready.    Clementine, do you really think you   could take care of a kid?       I don't want to talk about this here.    Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --    Oh, thank God. It's going.    It's going, Clementine. All the crap   and hurt and disappointment. It's   all being wiped away.    Me, too.    So, um --    You're drunk.    No, it isn't that.    I just don't have anything very   interesting about my life.    How's the chicken?    No. Thanks.    It's good.    Yeah, Tangerine?    No.       No! Jesus, No!    Please! Please! I've changed my mind!  (looks down at fading   Clementine, then at   ceiling)  I don't want this. Wake me up! Stop   the procedure! Plea --    ...die right now, Clem. I'm just...   happy. I've never felt that before.   I'm just exactly where I want to be.    Clem, no! This can't keep happening.   Please! Oh, fuck! Please!    You have to stop this!    I'm trapped in my head and everything   I love is being erased! Stop it now!       Yes indeed.  (snapping out of memory)  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!    I hired them to. We're in my brain.   But I want it to stop, before I wake   up and don't know you anymore.    I don't know.    Aaargh! It's horrible! I'm trapped!    I loved you on this day. I love this   memory. The rain. Us just hanging.    What do you mean?    Where? Where? Where?    I must be about two.     I want my mommy. She's busy. She's   not looking at me.  (back to himself, re:   doll)  Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll! I   told you about this!     I want my mommy!       I want my mommy.  (adult, to Clementine)  I don't want to lose you, Clem.    I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't   want to lose you. I don't want to   lose...    I really want her to pick me up.   It's weird how strong that desire   is.    I loved you so much this day. On my   bed in your panties. I remember I   thought, how impossibly lucky am I   to have you on my bed in your panties.    I came over to the bed and you smelled   so good, like you just woke up,   slightly sweaty. And I climbed on   the bed with you and you said   something like --    There's this guy!    There's this guy. I heard him talking   in my apartment. He's one of the   eraser guys. And he fell for you   when they were erasing you, so he   introduced himself the next day as   if he were a stranger and now you're   dating him.    He stole a pair of your panties while   you were being erased!       I love getting bathed in the sink.   It's such a feeling of security.    Don't call me Antoine. My name is   Wally.    They found us before. The plan didn't   work. I don't know what to do now.    This kid, Joe Early, is going to   beat the shit out of me.    He calls me Jill. Everyone calls me   Jill after this.    Just shut up, Joe. I'm going home.    I don't want to fight you.    I'm too scared to even throw a punch.   When I tell people this story I leave   that part out.    Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you.   Remember?    (continuing to   masturbate)  I don't like it either, but I'm just   trying to find horrible secret place   to --    Happy Birthday.    I scoured the city for it.    I can't. I have to go home. I'll do   it later.       That's where I live. Lived.    It was horrifying, seeing my father   like that. There was no hope for me   if his life was such a failure. And   he saw failure in me, too, written   in my future.    I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to   ride it out. Hiding is clearly not   working.    I want to enjoy my little time left   with you.    Do you remember what we talked about?    Yeah.    God, I should know. Your hair was   red. I remember it matched the   wallpaper.    No! I think you were wearing that   black dress, y'know, with the buttons.    Right. Something black though.    We did talk about Naomi.    I'm sure, I said.    I was so nervous. I remember I   couldn't think of anything to say.   There were long silences.    I thought I was foolish. I thought   I'd mistaken infatuation for love.   You said:    And I didn't have an argument.    I dropped you off after. You said --    It's very late.    This was our first time.    Naomi.    You take it. I don't know.    Naomi, I really value our   relationship. I hope it's possible   for us to stay in touch.    I told her today I need to end it.    I did it. I guess that means   something.    I don't know, I've just been thinking,   maybe we're not happy with each other.    Y'know, we've been, I don't know,   sort of, unhappy with each other and --    I think maybe, we're both so used to   operating at this level that -- How   can one person be unhappy? If one   person is unhappy, both have to be...   by definition.    No. I just need some space, maybe.    It's not somebody else.    Is there a Clementine who works here?    Hi.    Sorry to track you down like this.   I'm not a stalker. But I needed to   see you.    I'd like to... take you out or   something.    Not yet. Not married.    Okay.    I just think that you have some kind   of... quality that seems really   important to me.    I remember that speech really well.    You had the whole human race pegged.    I still thought you were going to   save me. Even after that.    It would be different, if we could   just give it another go around.    Thanks, guys.    Yeah.    Hi.    You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie   say hello.    Go back to sleep.    In a minute.    So you don't mind?    Okay. I wish you could come.    I hope you get your work done.    Just a little overworked, maybe.    I remember you turned around. Your   face was dark and your hair was   backlit -- I could see a halo of   frizz -- you asked me if things were   okay between Naomi and me.    I remember.    Yeah, you told me that later.    No one.    You were down by the surf. I could   just make you out in the dark.    Your back to me. In that orange   sweatshirt I would come to know so   well and even hate eventually. At   the time I thought, how cool, an   orange sweatshirt.    But I went back to my food. The next   thing I remember, I felt someone   sitting next to me and I saw the   orange sleeve out of the corner of   my eye.    Hi.    You said...    Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.    Even then I didn't believe you   entirely. I thought how could you be   talking to me if you couldn't talk   to people?    You know what I did.    You said --    And you picked it out of my plate   before I could answer and it felt so   intimate like we were already lovers.    I remember --    I'm Joel.    You mean, like...     Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh,   my darlin', Clementine... ?   Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?    Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing   when I was a kid was my Huckleberry   Hound doll. I think your name is   magic.    I know.    Enjoy it. Say good-bye.    So you're still on the Zoloft?    I know what you mean. That's why I   stopped.    I don't think I've slept in a year.    yeah?    Okay.    I love her.    I think she's great.    Did this conversation come before or   after we saw the house?    Seems too coincidental that way.    Yeah, yeah. It goes  Perhaps there   is someone in this world to whom I   could send all these lines ?    Um, no.    I do sort of live with somebody   though.    Female.    What are you doing?       Clementine.    I hesitated for what seemed like   forever.    I knew.    It's dark.    Naomi.    I think we should go.       I really should go. I really need to   catch my ride.    I did. I walked out the door. I felt   like I was a scared little kid. I   thought you knew that about me. I   ran back to the bonfire, trying to   outrun my humiliation. You said,  so   go  with such disdain.    I walked out the door. There's no   more memory.    I love you.    Hi... Naomi? Yeah, hi! How are you?   I know, I know. It's been a long   time. Not too much. You? Oh, that's   great! Congratulations! Maybe I could   buy you dinner to celebrate? Tonight?   I'm free. Okay, good!    It's been a pretty lonely couple of   years.    Well, it was my fault -- the break-  up. I'm sorry.    I miss you.       Oh! Great. That's great!    I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --    So you think the dissertation will   get published?    Yeah.    Tomorrow?    Yeah.    Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.    How's it going?    I know. I had to take the day to   think.    I just got in.    Yeah, I suppose so.    There you are.     Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we   fall back into this fast without   considering the problems we had...    I had a good time last night. I really   did.    We'll speak soon.    I just walked in.    Oddly enough, I do.    I guess so.    I don't know.    This is so beautiful.    I don't know. What if it breaks?    I think I should go back.    Listen, did you want to make love?    Have sex. Y'know --    Because I just am not drunk enough   or stoned enough to make that happen   right now.    I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that.   This seems like the perfect romantic   exotic place to do it and --    -- and I'm just too nervous around   you right now.    Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.    I'm nervous because I have and   enormous crush on you.    Did you send this? Is it a joke?    I mean, I haven't even told anyone   I've met you. Who would even know to   do this?    That's what you have to say? How   could it be true? I never even heard   of any procedure like this. It's a   joke.    It's true.    Look, I have to go. I have to think.    Says you were a bully...    That's what it says. You drank too   much, you picked on me for being   passive and timid.    Says you would sometimes disappear   all night, then brag to me about   your sexual conquests.    I don't know.    Says you were a slob, leaving trails   of panties and dirty socks in your   wake.       I sort of do. But I only see it as a   fantasy version of reality. Cleaned   up enough to be erotic.    You're so beautiful.    Hi, it's Joel.    I'm just, y'know, passing the time   best I can till I can see you.    You must have been crazy.    I don't know. Panties and --    Jesus.    I can't stop thinking about you.    What old mill? Is that somewhere we -- "

      "text": "  Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with   Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.  Okay, I guess.  Okay, I guess.  I don't care.  Well, I've been having a bad time of   it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.  What? No. I don't like the term   boyfriend. It's so gay.  Maybe gay isn't the right word. But,   anyway, it's been rough with him...   whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My   significant other... heh heh. And I   guess on a certain level, I want to   break it off, but I feel... y'know...   it's like this constant questioning   and re questioning. Do I end it?   Should I give it more time? I'm not   happy, but what do I expect?   Relationships require work. You know   the drill. The thing that I keep   coming back to is, I'm not getting   any younger, I want to have a baby...   at some point... maybe... right? So   then I think I should settle -- which   is not necessarily the best word --   I mean, he's a good guy. It's not   really settling. Then I think maybe   I'm just a victim of movies, y'know?   That I have some completely   unrealistic notion of what a   relationship can be. But then I think,   no, this is what I really want, so I   should allow myself the freedom to   go out and fucking find it. You know?   Agreed? But then I think he is a   good guy and... It's complicated.   Y'know?  Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --  God, yes. You've saved my life!     Ain't that the question of the   century.  You got grilled cheese and tomato   soup?     And some cream, please.     Hi!  Why?  Why are you sorry? I just said hi.  Really?  Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take   the leap and assume someone is talking   to you in an otherwise empty car.  It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't   have to scream. Not that I don't   need to scream sometimes, believe   me.     But I don't want to bug you if you're   trying to write or something.  Oh. So...  No, I don't want to bug you if you're   trying to --  Just, you know, to chat a little,   maybe. I have a long trip ahead of   me.     How far are you going? On the train,   I mean, of course.  Get out! Me too! What are the odds?  Ucch, really? You're kidding. God.   Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's   me: book slave there for, like, five   years now.  Jesus, is it five years? I gotta   quit right now.  Well, I'm there. I hide in the back   as much as is humanly possible. You   have a cell phone? I need to quit   right this minute. I'll call in dead.  I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy   before me.  Ah, the hair.   Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin.   The color. Snappy name, huh?  Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you   were wondering.  Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?  Anyway, this company makes a whole   line of colors with equally snappy   names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever,   Green Revolution. That'd be a job,   coming up with those names. How do   you get a job like that? That's what   I'll do. Fuck the dole.  Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.     Someone's got that job.     Agent Orange! I came up with that   one. Anyway, there are endless color   possibilities and I'd be great at   it.  My writing career! Your hair written   by Clementine Kruczynski.     The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.  I think. Anyway, I've tried all their   colors. More than once. I'm getting   too old for this. But it keeps me   from having to develop an actual   personality. I apply my personality   in a paste. You?  Well, you don't know me, so... you   don't know, do you?  Yeah, I got it.  My name's Clementine, by the way.  No jokes about my name? Oh, you   wouldn't do that; you're trying to   be nice.  Huckleberry Hound?  Huckleberry Hound! What, are you   nuts?     Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my   darlin' Clementine? No?     Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a   vindictive little bitch, truth be   told.     Why wouldn't you think that about   me?  Now I'm nice? Don't you know any   other adjectives? There's careless   and snotty and overbearing and   argumentative... mumpish.  I just don't think  nice  is a   particularly interesting thing to   be.  What is nice, anyway? I mean, besides   an adjective? I guess it can be an   adverb, sort of.  It doesn't reveal anything. Nice is   pandering. Cowardly. And life is   more interesting than that. Or should   be. Jesus God, I hope it is...   someday.     I know it's here.  I don't need nice. I don't need myself   to be it and I don't need anyone   else to be it at me.  Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold   on.  Damn it. DAMN IT!     Oh. Here.  Joel? It's Joel, right?  I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it   yelling? I can't really tell.   Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts   today.     My embarrassing admission is I really   like that you're nice. Right now,   anyway. I can't tell from one moment   to the next what I'm going to like.   But right now I'm glad you said,    that's okay  to me. That was nice   of you.  Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  (stands, throws bag   over shoulder)  Take care, then.     Unless I get that hair-color-naming   job.  No, that's okay. Thanks, though.  I don't want to take you out of your   way.  Yeah?  You're not a stalker or anything,   right?  You can't be too careful. I've been   stalked. I've been told I'm highly   stalkable. I don't need that.     You know Wilmont?  Wilmont. Near the high school.  Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort   of nutso. I'm not really.  So you like bookstores, huh?  Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.  The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent   most of the train ride trying to   remember.  Till you're full of rag   water and bitters and blue ruin/And   you spill out/Over the side to anyone   who'll listen.  Remember?  Remember?  And you take on the dreams   of the ones who have slept there/And   I'm lost in the window/I hide on the   stairway/I hang in the curtain/I   sleep in your hat...      Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.  I'm just a bit of a wreck.  I sleep   in your hat  makes me cry.     Me.  Thanks very much. That was very nice   of you.  Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already   told you that.     Anyway. See Ya.     Hey, do you want to have a drink? I   have lots of drinks. And I could --  Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid.   I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.  Thanks. I like it, too. Been here   about four years. It's really cheap.   My downstairs neighbor is old so   she's quiet, which is great. And the   landlord's sweet, which is bizarre,   but great, and I have a little porch   in the back, which is great, because   I can read there, and listen to my   crickets and...  Two blue ruins...  You like that?  This... someone gave that to me,   just like, recently. I like it, too.   I like crows. I think I used to be a   crow.  Do you believe in that stuff?   Reincarnation?  Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription   on the back.  (takes it off the   wall, reads:)  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The   dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has   given my heart/A change of mood/And   saved some part/Of a day I rued.     Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost   lover by any stretch. His stuff seems   strictly grade school to me. But   this made me cry for some reason.   Maybe because it is grade school.   Y'know?  I miss grade school. I don't know   why I'm calling it grade school all   of a sudden. When I went we called   it elementary school. But I like   grade school better. Sounds like   something someone from the forties   would call it. I'd like to be from   then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway,   cheers!  God, that feels so fucking good.   Take yours off.  Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.  Ready for another?  Well, I'm ready. Put some music on.  Oh, excellent choice.  Mmmmmmm. Way to go, Joel. You pick   good.  No, stay. Just for a little while.  (opens her eyes,   brightly)  Refill?  I know a man who needs a refill.  God bless alcohol, is what I say.   Where would I be without it. Oh,   Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, maybe I   don't want to think about that.  Drink up, young man. It'll make the   whole seduction part less repugnant.  I'm just kidding. C'mon.  Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.  Well, I go to a psychic and she's   always telling me I'm psychic. She   should know. Do you believe in that   stuff?  Me neither. But sometimes I have   premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe   that's just coincidence. Right?   Y'know, you think something and then   it happens, or you think a word and   then someone says it? Y'know?  Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my   feeling about it. It's hard to know.   Like, okay, but how many times do I   think something and it doesn't happen?   That's what you're saying, right?   You forget about those times. Right?     But I think I am. I like to think I   am.  It's helpful to think there's some   order to things. You're kind of closed   mouthed, aren't you?  Oh.     Does that make you sad? Or anxious?   I'm always anxious thinking I'm not   living my life to the fullest, y'know?   Taking advantage of every possibility?   Just making sure that I'm not wasting   one second of the little time I have.  You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled   at you before about it. God, I'm an   idiot.  I like you. That's the thing about   my psychic thing. I think that's my   greatest psychic power, that I get a   sense about people. My problem is I   never trust it. But I get it. And   with you I get that you're a really   good guy.  And, anyway, you sell yourself short.   I can tell. There's a lot of stuff   going on in your brain. I can tell.   My goal... can I tell you my goal?     What's the goal, Joel?     My goal, Joel, is to just let it   flow through me? Do you know what I   mean? It's like, there's all these   emotions and ideas and they come   quick and they change and they leave   and they come back in a different   form and I think we're all taught we   should be consistent. Y'know? You   love someone -- that's it. Forever.   You choose to do something with your   life -- that's it, that's what you   do. It's a sign of maturity to stick   with that and see things through.   And my feeling is that's how you   die, because you stop listening to   what is true, and what is true is   constantly changing. You know?  Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't   need any more reason to do it. Who   knows what bigger cosmic reason might   exist?  You're very nice. God, I have to   stop saying that. You're nervous   around me, huh?  I'm nervous. You don't need to be   nervous around me, though. I like   you. Do you think I'm repulsively   fat?  I don't either. I used to. But I'm   through with that. Y'know, if I don't   love my body, then I'm just lost.   You know? With all the wrinkles and   scars and the general falling apart   that's coming 'round the bend.     So, I've been seeing this guy...     Well, for the last week, anyway!   He's kind of a kid. Kind of a   goofball, but he's really stuck on   me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't   like that? And he's, like, a dope,   but he says these smart and moving   things sometimes, out of nowhere,   that just break my heart. He's the   one who gave me that crow photograph.  That made me cry. But, anyway, we   went up to Boston, because I had   this urge to lie on my back on the   Charles River. It gets frozen this   time of year.  Exactly! I used to do it in college   and I had this urge to go do it again,   so I got Patrick and we drove all   night to get there and he was sweet   and said nice things to me, but I   was really disappointment to be there   with him. Y'know? And that's where   psychic stuff comes in. Like, it   just isn't right with him. Y'know?  I don't believe in that soulmate   crap anymore, but... he says so many   great things. We like the same   writers. This writer Stephen Dixon   he turned me on to. And he's cute.   It's fucked up. Joel, you should   come up to the Charles with me   sometime.  Yeah? Oh, great!  I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic --   night picnics are different -- and --     You should stay.     Okay.  I would like you to call me. Would   you do that? I would like that.  You'll call me, right?  When?  Tonight. Just to test out the phone   lines and all.  You were not.  Come over after I'm done here?  You rat.     You didn't say anything about my   hair.  In the room?  Yo ho ho!  Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing.   I kinda sorta wrecked your car...  ...a little. I was a little tipsy.   Don't call me pathetic.  Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody.   It's just a fucking dent. You're   like some old lady or something.  A wino? Jesus, Are you from the   fifties? A wino!     Face it, Joel. You're freaked out   because I was out late without you,   and in your little wormy brain, you're   trying to figure out, did she fuck   someone tonight?     Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.  How can you watch this crap?  I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.     I want to have a baby.  No. I want to have a baby. I have to   have a baby.  You're not ready.  What?!  Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about   it!  You can't fucking say something like   that and say you don't want to talk   about it!     I'd make a fucking good mother! I   love children! I'm creative and smart   and I'd make a fucking good mother!  It's you! It's you who can't commit   to anything! You have no idea how   lucky you are I'm interested in you!   I don't even know why I am! I should   just end it right here, Joel. Leave   you in the zoo. Maybe you could find   a nice sloth to hang out with!  I'm glad.     Would you get me another, Joely?  Thanky! Thanky!  Joel, this is Mark. He likes my boobs.   He came over special to tell me that.   Isn't that nice. He doesn't think   I'm fat.  S'okay, Mark. Joel doesn't like my   boobs.     I don't think he likes girls.  You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --  You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm   an open book. I tell you everything.   Every damn embarrassing thing. You   don't trust me.  I want to know you.  Joel, you're a liar.  Good.  More?  How's the fish?  Joely...  Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?  It's my favorite book. Since I was a   kid. It's about these toys. There's   this part where the skin Horse tells   the rabbit what it means to be real.     I can't believe I'm crying already.   He says,  It takes a long time. That's   why it doesn't often happen to people   who break easily or have sharp edges,   or who have to be carefully kept.   Generally by the time you are Real,   most of your hair has been loved   off, and your eyes drop out and you   get loose in the joints and very   shabby. But these things don't matter   at all, because once you are Real   you can't be ugly, except to people   who don't understand.   I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared.   I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm   getting old and nothing makes any   sense to me.  Nothing makes any sense. Nothing   makes any sense.  Come up to Boston with me?  Now. Now! I have to go now. I have   to see the frozen Charles! Now!   Tonight!  Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my   shit.  I'm so excited. Yay!  It's gorgeous.     Just my taste. I've never gone out   with a guy who brought me a piece of   jewelry I liked.     Thanks. So let's get going. Long   drive.  Such a beautiful view.  Oh?  Wow. Um, well... can't you just force   yourself awake?  What if you hide me?     Well... if they're looking for me in   memories I'm in, what if you take me   to a memory I'm not in?     And we can hide there till morning.  Jesus. What's this?  I'm right here.  Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading.   The memory. I think we're hidden.  You know, we're okay. They're not   finding us. You'll remember me in   the morning. And you'll come to me   and tell me about us and we'll start   over.  You remember what happened next?  -- another rainy day. Whatever shall   we do?  What?  Really? Is he cute?  Gross! You must remember to tell me   this in the morning. I'm, like, so   freaked out now.  What's wrong with me?     I've never seen you happier.  But can't you see... I love you,   Antoine.  Yes, but I can't love a man named   Wally.     Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere   buried?  Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?  Poor Joel.  Our house! Our house!     Joel!     Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!  Oh, Joel. It's beautiful!     I mean, you're the first guy who   ever bought me a piece of jewelry I   could honestly say that about.  I love it!  It's okay. You were a little kid.     This is a great birthday present.   Getting to see you as a boy.  I want to go home.  I love this book, Joel. Thank you so   much for telling me about it.  Joel, you're not sewn in. He's wrong.  Yeah.  This is our first  date  date.  Naomi, I guess.  What was I wearing?  Egad, were you horrified?  No, you were with me when I bought   that. At that place on East 6th. It   was later.  I'll buy that. Black's always good.  I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.  But you weren't. I could tell.  So what. Infatuation is good, too.     Come up and see me... now.  Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.  Is that what you want?  I didn't think you'd show your face   around me again. I figured you were   humiliated. You did run away, after   all.     Yeah?  Well, you're married.  Look, man, I'm telling you right off   the bat, I'm high maintenance. So   I'm not going to tiptoe around your   marriage or whatever it is you got   going there. If you want to be with   me, you're with me.  So make your domestic decisions and   maybe we'll talk again.  Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you   to just keep that in your head. Too   many guys think I'm a concept or I   complete them or I'm going to make   them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up   girl who is looking for my own peace   of mind. Don't assign me yours.     I had you pegged, didn't I?  Probably.  I know.  Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we   can.  Hi there.  I saw you sitting over here. By   yourself. I thought, thank God,   someone normal, who doesn't know how   interact at these things either.  I can't tell you how happy I am to   hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm   happy you're uncomfortable, but,   yknow... I'm such a loser. Every   time I come to a party I tell myself   I'm going to be different and it's   always exactly the same and then I   hate myself after for being such a   clod.  But, I don't know, maybe we're the   normal ones, y'know? I mean, what   kind of people do well at this stuff?  You did? You liked me?  Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.  I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece   of your chicken?  Oh God, how horrid.  Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?  Yeah, like that.     This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone   soon.  What do we do?  No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel   like I was being artificially   modulated.  But my sleeping is really fucked up.  You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a   chemical and all, but it works...   and it works just having it around,   knowing that it's there. Like   insurance.  I'll give you a couple. See what you   think.  Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?  Really? Me, too! I don't meet people   who even know who she is and I work   in a book store.  Me too. There's this poem --  I think, before.  Yeah, maybe.  Do you know her poem that starts    Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house   in which we don't live...  Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my   heart. I'm so excited you know it.     Look, houses in which we don't live.  I wish we did. You married?  Let's move into this neighborhood.  Oh.  Male or female?  At least I haven't been barking up   the wrong tree.  Cool.  It's freezing out here.  C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's   coming here tonight, believe me.   This place is closed up. Electricity's   off.  I could see you wanted to come in,   Joel.  As soon as you walked in. I knew I   had you. You knew I knew that, right?  I knew by your nervousness that Naomi   wasn't the kind of girl who forced   you to criminally trespass.  Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?  Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles,   matches, and the liquor cabinet.  No, it's our house! Just tonight --     -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which   one do you want to be? I prefer to   be Ruth but I'm flexible.     Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going   find the bedroom and slip into   something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at   the moment.     So go.     What if you stay this time?  Come back and make up a good-bye at   least. Let's pretend we had one.  Bye, Joel.  I --  So you'll call me, right?  When?  Tonight. Just to test out the phone   lines.  Don't worry. It's really solid this   time of year.  Isn't it?  What if?  Joel, come here. Please.  Make love?  Oh, um...  That's okay. I --  Hey, Joel --  I'm nervous, too.  Well, you obviously don't know me.  Show me which constellations you   know.  Maybe. Call someone who'd know.  Says you were closed off, non   communicative, never told me what   you were feeling.     A bully? Moi?  Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.     Says you were jealous and suspicious.  Did I use the term  sexual conquests    or is that your way of putting it.  Doesn't sound like me.  Says you were constantly calling me   a slob.     It's sexy that we were like a married   couple, griping and overly-familiar   and bored. Don't you think?  We should have sex. It's old hat for   us.  You know my body like the back of   your hand.  Every curve, every freckle.  You're still excited by my   irreverence. You haven't yet started   to think of it as my  gratuitous   need to shock.   Yay. Meet me after work by the old   mill.  I just wanted to say that. Come by   my house."
