I\nused to waitress at her country\nclub, and with her, it's all about\nwhat private school you went to and\nwho you know. You still up for that\npromotion?

And thanks for choosing\nBank of California.\nEllen plays along.\nT\n6.\nELLEN\nOkay. Then I'll see you later. I\nmean--- whenever the next time I'm\nin the bank.

JACKS\nSomeone has definitely brought an\nanimal in here.\nHe eyes Ellen suspiciously as she exits.\nSTEPHANIE\nI don't see any cats. Or any\nanimals.\nMR. JACKS\nHope to hell, not.\nSTEPHANIE\nBy the way, I put the paperwork for\nthe Mcpherson loan on your desk.\nMR. JACKS\nMcpherson?\nSTEPHANIE\nThat big corporate loan I've been\ntrying to set up?

Right now it's\nbetween Stu and yourself.\n4\n7.\nSTEPHANIE\nStu? The trainee?\nStephanie turns to see Stu, the balding loan officer who sits\nat his desk, watching, trying to figure out what Jacks is\nsaying to her.\nMR. JACKS\nI know he's new but he's also quite\naggressive and we like that. Don't\nget me wrong, you're well liked\nhere, but we're also looking for\nsomeone who's not afraid to crunch\nthe numbers and make the tough\ndecisions.\nSTEPHANIE\nMr. Jacks, I feel that I'm\nperfectly capable of--\nMR. JACKS\n--I'll let you know as soon as,I\ndecide. In the meantime, take him\nthrough our loan qualifying\nprocedures... just in case.\nSTEPHANIE\nOh. okay.\nMR JACKS\nAnd would you mind taking your\nlunch now?\nSTEPHANIE\nSure.\nMR. JACKS\nAnd on your way back, maybe you\ncould bring me a turkey club?\nStu overhears them as he passes by.\nSTU\nTurkey club. Excellent choice, J.J.\nThen to Stephanie:\nSTU\nMind picking one up for me?\n8.\nSTEPHANIE\nNo problem.\nJacks heads back toward his desk. Stephanie grabs her purse\nand keys and as she heads out, Stu calls after her:\nSTU\nOn toasted rye! And spicy mustard!\nStephanie doesn't like fetching lunch for the trainee but\nhides her displeasure.\nSTEPHANIE\nSure."

It is\noften summoned by the Gypsies for\ntheir dour deeds. On the third day\nthe Lamia comes for the owner of\nthe accursed object.\nSTEPHANIE\nAccursed object?

Stymied, she tucks the button back into her coat\npocket.\nSTEPHANIE\nThere's got to be something I can\ndo.\nRHAM JAS\nYes. There are many ways to appease\na spirit. The simplest is a blood\noffering. An animal sacrifice. A\nsmall creature would do. You could\nsacrifice a chicken. It's all in\nhere...\nRham Jas produces a modern book on animal sacrifice which he\nsets before her.\nSTEPHANIE\nNo way. I'm a vegetarian. I'm a\nmember of PETA, for Christ's sake.\nI don't go around killing animals.\nRHAM JAS\nYou will be surprised what you will\nbe willing to do when the Lamia\ncomes for you.\nShe considers his words, looks down to the book.\nCLOSE ON A DIAGRAM OF AN ANIMAL SACRIFICE - A creature's\nheart being cut from it's body.\nCAMERA pulls back to reveal that Stephanie now site at her\nkitchen table, reading the book. We see other diagrams: The\nheart being placed into a skillet over an open fire. The\nburial of the smoking heart. Stephanie's kitten PURRS, as it\nrubs against her leg.\nStephanie closes the book, shutting out the disturbing\nimages.\nShe hears the SHRIEK of the rusty gate outside. She moves to\nthe window and peers out. The rusting iron gate is open.\nStephanie senses a change in the room... Shadows shift and\ngrow deeper. The air is suddenly oppressive. Something is\ncoming.\n45.\nShe moves to the front door and puts her ear to it. Quiet.\n1b But then--\nSCRATCH... SCRATCH...\nShe runs upstairs into her bedroom and locks the door."

In the\nbottom of the pit Stephanie has unearthed the simple pine\ncasket. She jams the shovel blade between two boards and\npries off the coffin's top and shoves it aside.\nA lightning flash illuminates the corpse. Mrs. Ganush's white\neye is open and staring at Stephanie.\nStephanie stows her fear and pulls the white envelope from\nher coat.\n16 40\n86.\nSTEPHANIE\nI'm giving it back to you.\nShe grabs Mrs. Ganush's hand and tries to get her clenched\nfist to open, but rigor morris has locked it shut. Stephanie\npulls with all her might, causing...\nMRS. GANUSH'S CORPSE\nto lurch up and out of the coffin. Her dead arms, thrown\nforward from the momentum, wrap around Stephanie. Stephanie\nSCREAMS! The withered face leers! Stephanie pushes the corpse\naway from her and the lifeless body falls back into the mud.\nSTEPHANIE\nYou'll take it, all right...\nShe picks up the shovel and jams the blade into the old\nwoman's mouth, wedging it between her teeth. She pries the\njaw open. Mud and rivulets of water begin pouring down into\nthe grave from all sides. The body of Mrs. Ganush is quickly\nbeing re-buried.\nSTEPHANIE\nI, Stephanie Brown, do hereby make\na formal gift of this button to\nyou, Sylvia Ganush.\nShe jams the white envelope down the old woman's throat.\nSTEPHANIE\nChoke on it, bitch.\nShe kicks the old woman's jaw.. It SNAPS shut, trapping the\nenvelope between her broken teeth.\nMuddy water cascades down into the grave, flowing over Mrs..\nGanush's face. It covers everything, except the jutting\nenvelope and a single, staring white eye.\nStephanie tries to climb out but the walls are too slick.\nShe grabs at a clump of sod at the top of the hole but it\ntears away, unleashing an avalanche of mud that buries her up\nto her armpits.\nTHE HEAD OF MRS. GANUSH\nBobs up, through the mud. The Old Woman is grinning, with the\nenvelope still jammed between her teeth.\n87.\nLONG SHOT - THE GRAVE\nRivers of muddy water now pour in from every direction. It\nhas become the drain hole of the cemetery.\nTHE INFLUX OF MUD\npushes the old woman corpse against Stephanie. Her grinning\nface led mashed against Stephanie's cheek. Stephanie's SCREAM\nis cut short as she and Mrs. Ganush disappear beneath the\nmud.\nThe only sound is the PITTER-PATTER of rain. CAMERA STARTS TO\nPULL AWAY when...\nSTEPHANIE'S HAND\nrips up through the mud, grasping the tree root.\nSTEPHANIE'S HEAD\nBreaks the surface of the mud, sucking in air. She claws her\nway out, then staggers away, through the pouring rain."
