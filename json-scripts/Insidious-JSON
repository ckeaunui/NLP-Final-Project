This\nmovement is followed by something that is hard to miss--\nOne of the tacks pinning one of Dalton's drawings to the wall\nbegins to wind loose.\nIt pops free, shooting across the room like a kernel of\npopcorn...followed by another tack.\nThe second tack lands in Josh's lap. Puzzled, he picks it up,\nexamining it. He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on\nthe wall.\nWith total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks\nworks themselves free, popping out of the wall.\nThe drawing floats down to the ground.\nJosh stoops down, picking it up.\nIt is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a\nself portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from\nabove.\nThe right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars\nand bloated planets.\nDalton has drawn another version of himself on this side,\nflying above the house with another man.\nAt the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last\nnight I watched myself sleep'.\nA tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and\npainful tears he has long pent up.\nBeneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.'"
