His skull is\nbullet-shaped and completely shaven like Billy's, Enhancing\nthis effect, he has no eyebrows, and his pale blue eyes\n(suggesting a trace of Indo-European stock in his ancestry)\nare set deep in his skull somewhat like turtle eyes, giving\nnothing away. His nose is a beak of skin his neck broad,\nhis mouth a small crescent that moves as lightly as his\nfeet between anger and amusement. He approaches BILLY,\nlooks into his eyes, drawing out the moment for himself,\nenjoying the tension and the fear he instils in others.\nBILLY meets his eyes respectfully, then realizing this is\nperhaps not the thing do to, looks away. But, fascinated\nby the man's features beyond his self-control, he looks\nback.\nHAMIDOU, amused by eye actions, smiles thinly. The sort of\nsmile that could imply friendship such is its hint of charm."

A\nbunch of them vehemently lay bets on the soccer game.\nOther aspects of the prison which should become evident:\n1) NOISE - continuous, Loud.
