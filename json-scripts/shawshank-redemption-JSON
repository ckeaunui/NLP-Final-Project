No sooner is the door shut than\nthey're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at\nflesh, mouths locked together.\nHe gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over\ninstead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like\ngetting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She\narches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against\nthe wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear.\nHe enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the\nwall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not\ncaring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with\nthe sensations running through her. He carries her across the\nroom with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed.\nCAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling\nsmoothly outside...\n2 EXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2\n...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the\nlovers' cries spilling into the night...\n...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting\npassion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of\ncrickets and hoot owls...\n...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and\nincongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until...\n...a car is revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked in a clearing.\n3 INT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3\nANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit.\nUnder normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly\ndangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far\nfrom normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A\ncigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are\nriveted to the bungalow up the path.\nHe can hear them fucking from here.\nHe raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio\nplays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him:\nYou stepped out of a dream...\nYou are too wonderful...\nTo be what you seem...\nHe opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped\nin a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --\n-- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil.\nHe grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over\nthe seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap,\nloading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim.\nSix in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow.\nHe shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant\nlovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then\nopens the door and steps from the car.\n4 EXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4\nHis wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to\nthe ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters.\nHe starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he\ngets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more\nfrenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of\npassion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts."
