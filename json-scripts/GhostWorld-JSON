Many\nof the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT.\nAs we track past at window-level we see:\nA glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER\nruns amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays..\nAn empty room...\nA large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts,\nwatching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed\npotatoes with his fingers...\nA dazed old woman staring out the window.\nThe silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself.\nWe enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the\nTHEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production\nnumber from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of\nclothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted\nback as she dances along to the video while trying on a\nGRADUATION CAP AND GOWN."
