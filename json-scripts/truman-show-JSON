We slowly\npull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the\nfirst until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room\nthe size of a football field.\nThe curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the\nceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile.\nInvestigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from\nall over New York City, covering every facet of Truman's life.\nCamera angles from the interior of Truman's house, his backyard,\ncar, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore\nto which he is drawn, the park he visits with Veronica, the\nabandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon, many of the\nlocations strangely devoid of people.\nBeneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk, its\nilluminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom.  Facing the\ndesk, several OPERATORS in high-backed, high-tech swivel chairs,\nwearing the slimmest of headsets.  SIMEON, a meticulous young\nman with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the\nlargest of the monitors, co-ordinating camera angles.\nCHRISTOF stands over Simeon's shoulder, staring intently at the\nlive picture of Truman now seated at a streetside cafe,\ncontinuing to inspect his surroundings.  CHLOE hovers in the\nbackground.\nThere is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the\nproduction crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first\ntime.  Christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a\nmicrophone on the control panel."

His will, draining away.\nAs he is about to be overcome by the next wave, he thrusts his\narm into the handles of the spinning wheel.  He cries out in\npain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the\nwheel.  He braces for one last wave.\nBut the wave does not come.  A strange phenomenon is occurring\nin the ocean.  A distinct division has appeared in the ocean\nswell.  Between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of\ncalmer water, several hundred yards wide, a curious escape lane.\nThe wind and the rain are also subsiding, the darkness lifting.\nTruman steers his vessel down this \"sea-lane\".\nAfter some time, several large, dark shapes emerge on the\nhorizon.  Land?  Islands?  As Truman steers towards the nearest\nshape, he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations.\nIt is certainly not the moon.\nThe dark shape is a huge iron roller, only half of which is\nexposed above the surface of the sea.  The ocean swell is being\ncaused by the roller slowly turning, mechanically-driven on\neither end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed.\nIn fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in\nboth directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see,\nthe calm sea-lanes formed by the gaps between the rollers.\nTruman's boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines.  The exposed\nhalf of each roller, the height of a ten story building, its\nlength equivalent to several football fields.  The massive arms\nperpetually churn.\nTruman's face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly\npast the giant rotating drum.  The water beyond the rollers is\ndead calm.  Truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his\neyes.\nBut if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to\ncomprehend, it pales in comparison with the next sight that\ngreets him.  His boat is drifting inexorably, on a slow\ncollision course with the sky.  That infinitely receding horizon\nline recedes no more.\nThe sea really does meet the sky.  The join is only too\napparent.  Looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of\ncolossal dimensions.  The sky is nothing but a painted backdrop.\nTruman looks upward, straining his eyes to see the top of the\nsky, but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight.\nThe bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky, bumping\ngently into its latex surface.  Truman unties his bindings\nand stumbles across the deck to the side rail.  Clinging to the\nrail with one hand, he tentatively reaches out towards the\npainted cyclorama.  He touches the sky.\nHe feels the surface, puts both terrified hands against it.\nHie eyes well up with tears.  He presses his distraught face\ninto it.  He screams at the top of his voice.  No words.  A\nprimal scream.  A pained, animal howl."
