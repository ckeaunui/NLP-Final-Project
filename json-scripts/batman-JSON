He's asleep,\nhead nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.\nTHOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the\nsidewalk.

THOMAS and\nMARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle\nBRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF\nJOY. And then, without warning --\nA HANDGUN enters frame.\nThe WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps\nprotectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet,\nbegins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.\nMARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at\nher throat.\nThe GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But\nMARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.\nThe GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.\nThe instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The\npearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward\nthe sidewalk.\nA SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.\nTHOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek\nwe cannot hear --\n-- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.\nBRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a\nhandful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's\npurse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the\nboy.\nAlmost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his\nparents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny\nglinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around\nthem.\nHe looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the\nGUNMAN turns and runs.\nAND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-\nwinning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics\nwith their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped\ntightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.\nThere's only one difference.
