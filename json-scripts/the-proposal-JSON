GILBERTSON\nAnd where's that located?\nMARGARET\n(still no idea)\nIn his hometown.\nRICHARD\nSitka.\nMR. GILBERTSON\nIs that on Long Island?\nOnly Richard has the answer.   Margaret tries to cover.\nMARGARET\nWhy don't you tell him?\nRICHARD\nAlaska.\nMR. GILBERTSON\nYou're going to Alaska this weekend?\nMARGARET\n(Alaska???)\nYes.   Of course we're going to Alaska.\nThat's where Richard is from.\nGilbertson begins to walk around.   He's getting worked up.\nMR. GILBERTSON\nYou think you can beat me with this B-S\nstory?   Forcing your secretary...\nRICHARD\nAssistant.\nMR. GILBERTSON\n...assistant to marry you and then\nconveniently telling his family for the\nfirst time this weekend?\nMARGARET\nI'm sorry, Dante.   Did you not prepare for\nthat?\nMargaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.\n19.\nEnraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his\nappointment book and writes down some information.\nMR. GILBERTSON\nThe INS will see you both in ten days for\nyour official interview.   Your stories\nbetter match up on every account.\nMr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her\nthe piece of paper.\nMR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)\nCross all your T's and dot your I's with\nthis ruse, Ms. Mills.\nMARGARET\nThere are no \"T's\" or \"I's\" in \"Love\" Mr.\nGilbertson.\nGilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard.   Margaret goes back to\nher desk like this is all in a days work.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nWhy are you from Alaska?   Sweet Jesus,\nthat's inconvenient.   So here's what's going\nto happen.   We'll play boyfriend and\ngirlfriend this weekend for your parents and\nthat should be enough for this INS\ninterview.\nRichard doesn't react.   Margaret doesn't notice.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nSo you need to figure out the travel,\nschedule a justice of the peace for next\nweek, and get my lawyer on the phone.\nMargaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nBut first, run down and get me another\ncoffee from your girlfriend, this is cold.\nMargaret holds out her coffee cup.   Richard doesn't move.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nHello?   Richard?   Richard!\nRichard says his first words since Gilbertson left.\nRICHARD\nI quit.\nRichard leaves Margaret's office.   She still has her coffee cup\noutstretched in her hand.\n20."

Ice sculptures melt,\nchampagne is served on silver trays, and the buffet overflows\nwith salmon and king crab.\nMargaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some\nWELL WISHERS, Richard's parents, and Balzac.\nMARGARET\nI went to Union college in upstate New York.\nIt's a small liberal arts school that no one\nhas ever heard of.\nRichard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\n(looks at glass)\nLime?\nRICHARD\nBe right back.\nRichard leaves to fetch lime wedges.   Geoffrey elbows Debbie in\nthe side, \"What was that?\"\nWELL WISHER #1\nHow long have you been with your company?\nMARGARET\nSince I graduated college.\nRichard comes back with the lime.   Margaret takes it and doesn't\nsay thank you.\nRICHARD\nShe's been there since she was nineteen.\nGEOFFREY\nNineteen?   Wow.   That's how long?\nMARGARET\nOh, who's counting...\nGeoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her.\nGEOFFREY\nNo.   How many years is that?   Exactly.\nMargaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look.\nMARGARET\nWell, let me see.   That would be sixteen or\nseventeen years.   Exactly.\n37.\nGEOFFREY\nI was never good with big numbers.   That\nmakes you... thirty six now?\nMARGARET\nJust turned thirty seven.   Born on May 20th.\nI'm a Taurus.\nGeoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\n(to Richard)\nI need some protein.\nRICHARD\nThere's some salmon.\nMargaret shakes her head no.\nRICHARD (cont'd)\nCrab?\nMargaret nods yes.   Richard steps away to find a waiter.\nGeoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding.\nGEOFFREY\nKeep him on a short leash, huh?   Does he\nroll over when you whistle?\nDebbie hits Geoffrey.\nDEBBIE\nHe's just being a good host.\nRichard comes right back with a waiter in tow.   For Geoffrey's\nbenefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard.\nMARGARET\nThank you, honey.   You're being so sweet.\nRichard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.\nRICHARD\nUh, sure.   Honey.\nWELL WISHER #2\nSo you just got some big promotion?\nMARGARET\nI'm editor in chief, now.\nRichard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret.\nRICHARD\n(BEAMING)\nI'm so proud of my girl.\n38.\nFrom behind them, a melodic, etherial VOICE interrupts.\nVOICE (O.S.)\nEditor in chief?   You're marrying up,\nRichard.\nEveryone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN (26).   She is\nGrace Kelly in Patagonia and Timberland.   Adding insult to\ninjury, she doesn't have eyeliner on.\nRICHARD\nGert!?\nRichard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and\nspilling her tonic water on her shirt.   He doesn't notice what\nhe's done, and leaves Margaret.   She's peeved.\nRICHARD (cont'd)\n(FLUSTERED)\nWhat are you?   What are you doing here?\nGERTRUDE\nYour dad made me come.\nRICHARD\nFrom Chicago?\nGertrude laughs.   The group watches these two see each for the\nfirst time in years.   There is instant chemistry, and Richard has\nforgotten about Margaret completely.\nGERTRUDE\nNo.   I live here now.\nRICHARD\nYou what?\nGERTRUDE\nI moved back about six months ago.   I'm\nteaching second grade.   At Baranof.\nRICHARD\nDid your husband move up here too?\nGERTRUDE\nUh, no.   I, ah, got divorced.\nRICHARD\nOh my God.   I'm sorry.\nGERTRUDE\nMe too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna\nmeet the bride.\nGertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret.\n39.\nGERTRUDE (cont'd)\nHi, I'm Gertrude.   But call me Gert.\nMARGARET\nYou're a Gertrude?\nGERTRUDE\nA family name from hell.\nMARGARET\nI'm sure it's been a curse.\nGEOFFREY\nGert and Richard were quite the item in high\nschool.\nGertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence.\nGERTRUDE\nOh Please.   Ancient history.\nGEOFFREY\nFeels like yesterday to me.\nGERTRUDE\n(ignoring Geoffrey)\nSo tell me everything.   I hear it wasn't\nexactly love at first sight?\nMARGARET\nNot exactly...\nGRANDMA ANNIE\nNow Richard, what I want to know is how you\nproposed.\nThis grabs the group's full attention.   Everyone loves to hear a\nstory like this.\nRICHARD\nWell...\nRichard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude.\nRICHARD (cont'd)\nUh, uh, um, I...\nGEOFFREY\nYeah.   How did you pop the question?\nRichard is a deer in the headlights.   This is getting ugly.\nMargaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in.\nMARGARET\nCan I tell this one, honey?\n40.\nRICHARD\nUh.   Sure.\nMARGARET\nI'm an early, early riser and go for a run\neveryday.   Well, it was our six month\nanniversary and I was out for my normal jog\nin the park, when who do I see in a horse\ndrawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting\nfor me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So\nI ran up to the carriage and asked him what\nwas going on, and he put his finger to his\nlips and says, \"shhhh.\"   So there I am in my\njogging clothes, next to the most handsome\nmute in the world - have you seen him in a\ntux? - riding like a sweaty princess and\nsmiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later,\nwe arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best\npart, we're the only people in the place\nbecause Richard got them to open up early.\nWell, we go to our table, sit down, and just\nas the sun starts to peek above the trees,\nthis beautiful man gets down on one knee,\nand says \"I didn't want one more sunrise to\ngo by without you knowing that you are the\nlight of my life, and that I would be the\nluckiest man in the world if you would be my\nwife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry\nme?\"\nThe group is silent, waiting for the clincher.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nI said yes.\nThe group gives a collective \"ahh\".   Grandma Annie takes both\nMargaret and Richard by the hand.\nGRANDMA ANNIE\nYou are a good boy Richard, and you make me\nvery proud.   I love you Richy.\nRICHARD\nI love you too, Grandma.\nGrandma hugs the couple.   Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and\nGertrude.\nGEOFFREY\nSo did this happen before or after the INS\nagent came sniffing around?\nDEBBIE\nWhat is wrong with you?   I'm sorry Margaret.\nMargaret doesn't miss a beat.\n41.\nMARGARET\nOh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my\nlawyers have been dealing with all of this.\nWhen you told us at the airport it was the\nfirst time I'd heard about it.   I'm so\nembarrassed.\nDEBBIE\nDon't be, dear.   Geoffrey's just an ass.\nWhile Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink\nthat says \"I've got this under control\".   The moment is\ninterrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He\ntakes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear.\nRICHARD\nMargaret Mill's phone.\n(off answer)\nOne second please.\nRichard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone.\nRICHARD (cont'd)\nIt's our friend, Frank.\nRichard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem.\nMARGARET\nExcuse me, I'll just be a second.\nMargaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that\nlead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't\nnotice Balzac follow her outside."

He makes sure that no one is in\nthe yard, pulls down his shorts, and hangs them up as well.\nIN THE BATHROOM\nNaked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret\nmanages to pull herself up by the toilet.   She wants a towel\nbadly, but Balzac guards the doorway.   She tries reason.\nMARGARET\nI'm sorry bout the eagle.   But I saved you.\nBalzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily.   Margaret grabs\nthe ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.\nON THE BEDROOM DECK\nRichard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is\nopen.   That's weird.\n55.\nIN THE BATHROOM\nMargaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat,\nready to strike.   Balzac will not be intimidated, and continues\nto growl and not let her out of the bathroom.   Margaret knows\nthat she can't hit a dog, and looks for another way out.   Then\nshe spots the bathroom mat.\nIN THE BEDROOM\nRichard saunters towards the bathroom, wearing only his iPod.\nIN THE BATHROOM\nBalzac puts a paw onto the bath mat.\nMargaret slowly puts back the toilet top.\nBalzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls\nhard, sliding the bath mat and Balzac to the back of the\nbathroom.   With Balzac out of the way, she runs out, closes the\ndoor behind her and...\nIN THE BEDROOM\nWHAM!   Margaret crashes into Richard and they fall to the floor.\nIt takes a second for them to realize that they are holding each\nother buck naked.\nMARGARET                                                             RICHARD\nAaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                        Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThe two quickly separate and spastically try to cover up.   A\nrapid fire back and forth ensues.\nMARGARET                                                             RICHARD\nWhy are you naked?

You're blaming the dog again?\nMARGARET\nWill you just hand me a towel!\nRichard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked.   When he looks\nunder the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes..\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nYou're flashing brain!\nRichard quickly changes positions.   Out of desperation, he pulls\nthe entire comforter off the bed.   He throws it Margaret's way,\nand she wraps herself in it.\n56.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nYou can cover up any time!\nRichard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by\nthe window.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nExplain yourself!\nRICHARD\nI didn't know you were home!   I was outside\nchopping wood!\nMARGARET\nYou didn't hear me?\nRICHARD\nI had my iPod on!\n(CONFUSED)\nWhy did you jump me?\nRichard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts.\nMARGARET\nI didn't jump you.\n(off Richard's look)\nI didn't mean to jump you.   I didn't know\nyou were here.\nRICHARD\nYou didn't see me?\nMARGARET\nI was running from the dog!\nRichard looks at Margaret suspiciously.\nRICHARD\nWait.   Were you tryin' to seduce me?\nMARGARET\nOh please!   Don't flatter yourself.\nRICHARD\nMmm-Hmmm.\nMARGARET\nGo take a shower.   You stink.\nRICHARD\nFine.   But don't come sneaking in there.\nYou're still my boss.   That'd be sexual\nharassment.\n57.\nRichard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door.   Margaret takes\na breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up\nagain.   Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his\nneck.   He gently puts him outside their room.\nRICHARD (cont'd)\nThere you go, buddy.   Go on and play before\nshe makes a coat out of you.\nRichard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom.   Without\nlooking back, Richard gets the final shot.\nRICHARD (cont'd)\nPuppy hater.\nLATER\nRichard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find\nto create himself makeshift bed on the floor.\nMargaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with\nthe sun still shining outside.   She gets into her bed.\nMARGARET\nI'm never gonna to get to sleep.\nRichard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down\noutside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and\nthe room is pitch black.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nOh.   Well.   Thanks.\nRichard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two\nsilently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.\nRICHARD\nIt was kinda weird seeing you naked.\nMARGARET\nCan we not talk about this?\nRICHARD\nI'm just saying.   It was weird.\nMARGARET\nIt wasn't weird.\nRICHARD\nHow was that not weird?\nMARGARET\nBecause we're... like teammates.\nRICHARD\nWe're like teammates?\n58.\nMARGARET\nWe are teammates.   And teammates see each\nother naked in the locker room.   All the\ntime.   It's not a big deal.\nRICHARD\nWell, if we're teammates can I sleep in the\nbed?\nMARGARET\nGood night, Richard.\nThe two lay awake in silence for another beat.\nRICHARD\nMargaret?\nMARGARET\nYes?\nRICHARD\nDon't take this the wrong way.\nMARGARET\nOkay...\nRICHARD\nYou're a very beautiful woman.\nMargaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard.\nMARGARET\nGet some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow."

One girl gets up.   Gertrude eyeballs her.\nGERTRUDE (cont'd)\nMarcia?\nCHILD #2\nSorry.\nThe child sits back down.   Gertrude waits a beat.\nGERTRUDE\nOK, everyone is excused for recess.\nAll the kids pop up and head to the door.   Mrs. Whiting directs\ntraffic outside.   Richard makes his way to Gertrude.\nRICHARD\nPatrick's right.   He did smell like eggs.\nGERTRUDE\nIt's still not a nice thing to say.

She\nsoon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN\ndancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a\ncarved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as\nhe spastically moves around the fire.

He was Russian and she\nwas Tlingit.\n(MORE)\n85.\nGRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)\nBack then, you had to get approval from\nevery person in the tribe before you got\nmarried.

Help!!!!!!!!\nRichard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her\nvoice.   He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that --\nMargaret's been swallowed by the ice.   Her upper torso sticks out\nof the glacier, held up by her arms.   Her eyes are wide, and\nshe's almost hyperventilating.     It's a bizarre sight.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nOh, thank God!\nRichard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.\nMargaret is really scared.\nMARGARET (cont'd)\nWh-, wh-, why are you laughing?\nRICHARD\nI'm sorry.

Don't do\nthat!\nRICHARD\nIt's not like that.   Really.   We do need to\nbe careful here though, I don't want us both\nto fall in.   Stay still, OK?\nMARGARET\nUh-huh.\nRichard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the\nice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way.\nRICHARD\nSo, I'm going to walk up to you and very\nslowly pull you out.   OK?\nMARGARET\nI'm really cold.\nRICHARD\nYeah, that's normal when you're surrounded\nby ice.\nMARGARET\n(makes sense)\nOK.\nRichard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to\nhis knee.   He calmly looks down on her.\nRICHARD\nSo I'm going to pull you up by your armpits.\nI'm probably going to touch boob.   But don't\nfreak out.\nMargaret shakes her head yes.   Richard reaches down and slowly\nlifts her out of the ice.   Margaret doesn't say a word.\nRICHARD (cont'd)\nWhen I get you all the way out, I need you\nto hold onto me.   I'm going to carry you\nover there.\nMargaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.   He's\nstrong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her \"over\nthe threshold\" style, away from the hole in the ice.   He speaks\nonce they're safe.\n92.\nRICHARD (cont'd)\nI've, uh, never done that before.\nMARGARET\nYou said it was \"no biggie\".\nRICHARD\nYeah.   Well.   You OK?\nMARGARET\nYeah.   I'm fine.\nRichard smiles.   Margaret smiles back.\nRichard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits\njust right.

Please.\nThe Handsome Man turns to Margaret.\nHANDSOME MAN\n(with genuine concern)\nDo you really feel like you're alone?\n112.\nMARGARET\nOh, good lord.\nCUT TO:"

Chuck crosses his fingers.\nMARGARET (O.S.)\n(from radio)\nWhat the hell are you doing?\nEveryone in the tower smiles.   They're making progress.\nRICHARD\nWe need to talk.\n(Intercut as necessary.   Margaret stands at the front of the\nplane with the passengers watching.)\nMARGARET\nAbout what?\nRICHARD\nHave you ever thought there might be a\nreason we've been together for the last\nthree years?\nMARGARET\nAs boss and assistant.\nRICHARD\nThings change, Margaret.\nMARGARET\n(INCREDULOUS)\nThings change?\nRICHARD\nYeah, things change.\nMARGARET\nIs that the best you got?\nGeoffrey hits Richard, as if to say \"see, that's what I said.\"\nRichard composes himself.\nRICHARD\nNow, tell me the truth.   When you left, were\nyou relieved or sad that we didn't have an\nexcuse to be together anymore?\nGeoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up.   That was a good one.\n113.\nMARGARET\nWhat's your point?\nRICHARD\nBecause I am sick that you left.   And if you\nfeel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be\ntogether?\nMargaret goes to answer, but stops.   Richard is right.   She wants\nto go back.   Even the passengers on the plane can see it.\nGilbertson panics.\nMR. GILBERTSON\nAre you thinking about going back to him?\nMargaret doesn't answer.\nMR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)\nWe have a deal!   You can't back out now!\nThe flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying\nto break up Richard and Margaret.\nFLIGHT ATTENDANT\nSir, you need to sit down.\nMR. GILBERTSON\nI will do no such thing.\nFLIGHT ATTENDANT\nSir, I'm ordering you to return to your\nseat.\nOther passengers yell \"sit down asshole\" at Gilbertson.\nMR. GILBERTSON\nWho said that?\nFLIGHT ATTENDANT\nSir, this is your third and final warning!\nMR. GILBERTSON\nListen sweetheart...\n(he pokes the flight attendant)\nI'm a federal officer, so why don't you get\nme another cocktail and mind your own...\nBUZZ! ZAP!                                                            400,000 Volts of electricity surge through\nGilbertson.   He twitches violently and crashes to the floor.\nBehind him, The Handsome Man holds a stun gun and a badge.\nHANDSOME MAN\nWell, I'm a federal Air Marshall.   And\nyou're under arrest for disobeying a crew\nmember, assault, and possible intoxication.\n114.\nThe Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around\nGilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom.   He then\ntakes the CB from Margaret and speaks to the passengers.\nHANDSOME MAN (cont'd)\nSorry everybody, but protocol says we need\nto get this unruly passenger off the plane\nASAP.   Sitka's the closest airport, so if\nit's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain\nturn this bird around.\nThere are wild cheers from the passengers.   Margaret blushes.\nHANDSOME MAN (cont'd)\n(winks at Margaret)\nTold you I was a romantic."

A little embarrassed.\nMARGARET\nI'm not the kind of girl who gets saved.\nRichard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and\nplants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him.\nThe long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.\nHANDSOME MAN\nUh, sorry, but excuse us.\nThe Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson\ndown the steps.\nMARGARET\n(to Gilbertson)\nHey!
