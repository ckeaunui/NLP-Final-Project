Looking like it's about to kill him. Hiccup\nis paralyzed. The dragon's breath ruffles his hair. Hiccup\nopens his eyes to find the Night Fury's wolf-like stare\nboring into him. The exchange is intense, profound.\nThe dragon draws a deep breath, as though it's about to torch\nhim, then lets out an ear-piercing scream instead. It turns\nand takes flight, flapping violently through the canopy of\ntrees. It bashes against a nearby mountain side, recovers,\nand drops out of view some distance away.\nWinded, Hiccup struggles to his feet, staggers a few steps,\ncollapses to his knees, and faints."

It's an occupational\nhazard.\nThey exchange smiles.\nSTOICK\nI'm proud to call you my son.\nHiccup beams, taken aback.\nHICCUP\nThanks dad.\nStoick lets go of Hiccup's arm.\nHiccup spurs Toothless on, charged with his father's belief\nin him. They rocket into the sky as Stoick watches.\nIN THE AIR\nAstrid sees Toothless streaking through the sky, gaining\naltitude.\nASTRID\nHe's up!\nShe turns to Ruffnut and Tuffnut, who are ARGUING and\nTHROWING PUNCHES at each other.\nASTRID (CONT'D)\nGet Snotlout out of there!\nIN MID-PUNCH, the twins look over to see Snotlout stranded on\nthe monster's head. They eye each other.\nTUFFNUT RUFFNUT\nI'm on it! I'm on it!\nTUFFNUT\nI'm on it first! I'm ahead of you.\nThe twins spot Snotlout on the giant dragon and steer their\nZippleback in his direction.\n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 95.\nRUFFNUT\nHey! Let me drive!\nThe twins peel off, ARGUING as they race each other to the\nmonster.\nSnotlout sees the Zippleback diving toward him and DASHES\ndown the Red Death's head. He runs up the end of its horn...\nAs the twins sweep past, both missing him... but perfectly\nsnatching him where the necks merge. Ruff and Tuff eye each\nother, surprised and impressed.\nTUFFNUT\nI can't believe that worked.\nThe Red Death spots Astrid and INHALES, preparing to blast.\nShe and her Nadder get caught in the suction, pulled toward\nthe monster's gaping mouth.\nON THE GROUND\nThe Vikings watch with dread. They hear the familiar whir of\nthe...\nGOBBER\nNight Fury! Get down!\nIN THE AIR\nA massive BLAST jolts the Red Death's head sideways. Astrid\nis thrown clear of its mouth... AND her Nadder. She tumbles\nthrough the air. The ground races toward her, when...\nShe's suddenly CAUGHT by the leg. She looks up to see\nToothless.\nHICCUP\nDid you get her?\nToothless grunts.\nON THE GROUND\nThey fly over the crowd of Vikings and set Astrid down, mid-\nrun. They circle back to reengage - a black speck against the\nclouds.\nASTRID\n(BREATHLESS)\nGo.\nIN THE AIR\n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 96.\nHiccup and Toothless rocket past the Red Death's head and\nclimb, higher and higher.\nHICCUP\n(TO TOOTHLESS)\nThat thing has wings! Okay, let's\nsee if it can use them!\nHiccup pulls Toothless into a turn. They plummet, gaining\ntremendous speed. The wind buffets them as they target the\nRed Death as super sonic speed.\nKABLAM! Toothless unloads a fireball against the Red Death's\nhead. It goes down with a rumble as they climb anew.\nON THE GROUND\nThe Vikings shield themselves from the dust of the fallen\nmonster... as its wings unfold and extend.\nIN THE AIR\nHiccup looks back as they put distance between them.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nDo you think that did it?\nSuddenly, the enraged behemoth RISES into frame... flapping\nits wings furiously. A daunting sight.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nWell, he can fly.\nHiccup and Toothless DIVE into the tangled sea stacks - they\nweave through the rock like rabbits through a briar. The Red\nDeath SNAPS at them, but cannot reach them. Hiccup and\nToothless PULL AHEAD.\nThe Red Death SMASHES through the canopy of rock and pulls in\nbehind Toothless. He BURSTS THROUGH fifty-foot formations\nlike they were saplings.\nON THE GROUND\nStoick, Gobber, and the Teens watch as Hiccup and Toothless\nstreak past, weaving through sea stacks.\nTEENS\nWoohoo! Yeah!\nA moment later the Red Death SMASHES the sea stacks to dust\nin hot pursuit. The Vikings mood is quenched.\nIN THE AIR\n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 97.\nHiccup and Toothless can't slow the monster down. Hiccup eyes\nthe clouds above. An idea hits him. He locks eyes with\nToothless.\nHICCUP\nOkay Toothless, time to disappear.\nToothless PULLS into a steep climb, heading toward the\nclouds.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nCome on bud!\nThe Red Death follows, closing in fast.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\n(hearing the gas)\nHere it comes!\nBLAST! They narrowly dodge a column of flame and smoke. They\nreach the low-hanging clouds and pierce them. The monster\nfollows, immediately losing them in the hampered visibility.\nIt roars irritably.\nFrom out of nowhere, Toothless DIVES at the huge dragon,\nBLASTING and PUNCTURING a hole in its wing. Toothless and\nHiccup are gone again before the dragon can get a shot at\nthem.\nON THE GROUND\nThe Vikings stare up at the sky listening to the resounding\nBOOMS and watching FLASHES light up the clouds.\nGobber places a hand on Stoick's shoulder.\nIN THE AIR\nHICCUP and TOOTHLESS dive in again and again, using the\nclouds to hide and surprise as they puncture the monster's\nwings.\nIt BELLOWS in frustration and WHIRLS around, unleashing fire\nblindly, in all directions.\nHiccup sees the glow of fire cutting towards them.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nWatch out!\nThe random blast CLIPS Toothless' tail. It's heavily damaged.\n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 98.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nOkay, time's up. Let's see if this\nworks.\nHe pulls Toothless into a turn. They fly directly into the\nRed Death's face, taunting it.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nCome on! Is that the best you can\ndo!?\nToothless utters an insult too, and they jackknife into a\nsteep dive. The Red Death pursues.\nToothless PUMPS his wings, racing faster than he's ever gone\nbefore. Hiccup and Toothless stay just ahead of the Red Death\n-- no longer trying to evade it.\nHiccup glances back to check the tail - it's disintegrating.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nStay with me buddy. We're good.\nJust a little bit longer.\nThe Red Death closes the gap. Hiccup tucks in and holds\nToothless steady -- allowing the monster to set its sights on\nthem. It narrows its eyes.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nHold, Toothless.\nThe Red Death OPENS his mouth. The familiar gas HISS emanates\nfrom his throat -- ignition is coming.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nNOW!\nHiccup HITS the PEDALS HARD as Toothless extends one wing.\nThey PIVOT in place, hurtling directly into the Red Death's\nmouth.\nToothless FIRES point blank down the monster's throat. Its\namassing gas is ignited, BACKFIRING into the monster,\nerupting in a chain of blasts throughout its body.\nHiccup and Toothless BURST from the clouds, the Red Death hot\non their tail, exploding from within. It glances forward and\nsees the ground rushing up. It throws open its wings,\nattempting to put on the brakes, but the punctured, damaged\nwings can't stop its momentum.\nAs the Red Death chokes on the expanding fireball, he sees\nToothless suddenly pull out of the dive, streaking up, past\nits head.\n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 99.\nThe Red Death HITS the ground, head-first. It EXPLODES like\nthe Hindenburg.\nHiccup and Toothless weave through the monster's massive back\nplates, wings, and flailing legs -- a high-speed recall of\nthe FREE FALL slalom run. The expanding fireball races toward\nthem, about to swallow them.\nThey manage to clear the obstacles. Hiccup glances back.\nThey're outrunning the fireball.\nHe looks forward just in time to see the monster's massive\nclub tail careening toward them.\nHe tries to shift their direction. The last shreds of\nToothless' tail tear away. Hiccup's pedals go DEAD.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nNo. No.\nHiccup and Toothless can't maneuver - they're dead in the\nair. The giant club tail CLIPS Toothless, TEARING Hiccup from\nthe harness and sending him tumbling against the backdrop of\nthe fast-approaching fireball.\nToothless STRUGGLES with all his might to reach the\nunconscious Hiccup. But the fireball swallows them both.\nON THE GROUND\nThe Vikings watch in horror as Hiccup and Toothless disappear\ninto the boiling inferno.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nA whiteout of ash. And through it comes...\nSTOICK\nHiccup? Hiccup!?\nStoick appears, searching desperately. Everything is\nscorched. Even the ground is smoking from the terrible heat.\nSTOICK (CONT'D)\nHiccup!? Son!?\nThrough the ash, Stoick the motionless silhouette of\nToothless.\nSTOICK (CONT'D)\n(GRAVE)\nHiccup.\n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 100.\nHe hurries to the dragon's side. Toothless is roughed up, but\nconscious. His scorched saddle, however, is vacant.\nStoick looks to the sky in despair. He buckles at the knees,\noverwhelmed by the loss.\nSTOICK (CONT'D)\nOh son...I did this...\nAstrid pushes through the crowd, her eyes welling up.\nFollowed by Gobber. They flank Stoick as he kneels, slumped\nover.\nBehind them, a ring of Vikings form, keeping a respectful\ndistance. As the dust and smoke clear, a ring of wild\ndragons can also be seen, gathering just behind and between\nthe Vikings.\nToothless stirs and groggily rolls his head toward Stoick.\nTheir eyes meet.\nSTOICK (CONT'D)\nI'm so sorry...\nToothless unfolds his wings, revealing Hiccup, unconscious,\nclutched safely against his chest. Stoick's eyes widen.\nSTOICK (CONT'D)\nHiccup.\nHe scoops Hiccup into his arms. Listens to his heart. Bursts\ninto relieved laughter.\nSTOICK (CONT'D)\nHe's alive!\n(TO TOOTHLESS)\nYou brought him back alive!\nThe crowd roars. Followed by the dragons. The Vikings look\naround to find themselves surrounded.\nStoick leans close to Toothless, meeting him eye to eye.\nSTOICK (CONT'D)\n(PRIVATELY)\nThank you... for saving my son.\nGobber looks Hiccup up and down.\nGOBBER\nWell, you know... most of him.\nStoick glances back at him. Gobber shrugs, redirecting his\neyes toward...\n\"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 101."

Now just--\nToothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT\nUPRIGHT with a YELP.\nHe looks around, confounded. He's in his bed, moved beside\nthe fire pit on the main floor of his house.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nI'm in my house.\n(re: Toothless, leaning\nover him, excited)\nYou're in my house.\nToothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far\ntoo big for the space.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\nUh...does my dad know you're in\nhere?!\nToothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He\neyes the rafters... and LEAPS UP onto them, brimming with\n'happy dog' energy.\nHICCUP (CONT'D)\n(DISTRESSED)\nOkay, okay -- no Toothless! Aw,\ncome on...\nHiccup shifts to get out of bed... then pauses... sensing\nthat something is wrong.\nHe peels back the covers slowly.

No one seems upset, there\nisn't a sword in sight.\nUnder the framework of a MASSIVE BARN, a Nadder BLASTS fire\nonto a metal brace. It steps back to let a Viking hammer it\ninto shape. Nearby, a Gronkle lands, carrying a tree trunk in\nhis mouth. He shows a Viking what he's found. The Viking pats\nhis head.
