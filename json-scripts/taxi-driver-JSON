   "text": "that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious\nphenomenon, is the central and inevitable fact of human\nexistence.\"\n--Thomas Wolfe,\n\"God's Lonely Man\"\nTRAVIS BICKLE, age 26, lean, hard, the consummate loner. On\nthe surface he appears good-looking, even handsome; he has a\nquiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from\nnowhere, lighting up his whole face. But behind that smile,\naround his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the\nominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness\nand loneliness. He seems to have wandered in from a land\nwhere it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants\nseldom speak. The head moves, the expression changes, but\nthe eyes remain ever-fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space.\nTravis is now drifting in and out of the New York City night\nlife, a dark shadow among darker shadows.  Not noticed, no\nreason to be noticed, Travis is one with his surroundings.\nHe wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt\nand a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading, \"King\nKong Company 1968-70\".\nHe has the smell of sex about him: Sick sex, repressed sex,\nlonely sex, but sex nonetheless. He is a raw male force,\ndriving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. Then one\nlooks closer and sees the evitable. The clock sprig cannot\nbe wound continually tighter. As the earth moves toward the\nsun, Travis Bickle moves toward violence.\nFILM OPENS on EXT. of MANHATTAN CAB GARAGE.  Weather-beaten\nsign above driveway reads, \"Taxi Enter Here\". Yellow cabs\nscuttle in and out. It is WINTER, snow is piled on the\ncurbs, the wind is howling.\nINSIDE GARAGE are parked row upon row of multi-colored taxis.\nEchoing SOUNDS of cabs idling, cabbies talking. Steamy\nbreath and exhaust fill the air."
