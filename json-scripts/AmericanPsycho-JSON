   "text": "An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side.\nThe decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged\nsilk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths\ndecorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous\nexotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and\nconfident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style:\npouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Ala\u00efa, Armani power suits.\nCLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.\nWAITER\nWith goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula\nCaesar salad. For entr\u00e9es tonight I have a swordfish\nmeatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge\nbreast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...\nHuge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen\ntable cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four\ninches square and look exactly alike.\nCLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of\nconversation. \"Is that Charlie Sheen over there?\" \"Excuse\nme? I ordered cactus pear sorbet.\"\nWAITER\nAnd grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our\npasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...\nCLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate\nperpendicular desserts descending on another table.\nPATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID\nVAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing\nexpensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back\nhair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses.\nThe camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:\nBATEMAN (V.O.)\nWe're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California\nplace on the Upper East Side.\nThe Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately\ndecorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's\ndescription of each of the men at the table.\nBATEMAN (V.O.)\nYou'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in\na remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences\nbetween us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van\nPatten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the\nbest looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a\nbad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten\nkeeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .\nVAN PATTEN\nWhat are the rules for a sweater vest?\nMcDERMOTT\nWhat do you mean?\nPRICE\nYes. Clarify.\nMcDERMOTT\nWell, is it strictly informal-\nBATEMAN\nOr can it be worn with a suit?\nMcDERMOTT\n(Smiling)\nExactly\nBATEMAN\nWith discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or\ncharcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder\nvest.\nMcDERMOTT\nBut avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or\ntie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look\ntoo studied.\nVAN PATTEN\nYou think so?\nPRICE\nYou'll look like you consciously worked for the look.\nVAN PATTEN\nGood point. Excuse me, gentlemen.\nVan Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy\ndiscreetly removes their largely untouched plates.\nBATEMAN\nVan Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?\nPRICE\nIt looks that way, doesn't it?\nMcDERMOTT\n(Staring at retreating waiter)\nDid he just take our plates away?\nPRICE\nHe took them away because the portions are so small he\nprobably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place.\nThis is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?\nMcDERMOTT\nBecause Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.\n(He guffaws)\nBateman throws a swizzle stick at him.\nMcDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man\nwith slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.\nMcDERMOTT\nIs that Reed Robinson over there?\nPRICE\nAre you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.\nMcDERMOTT\nWho is it then?\nPRICE\nThat's Paul Owen.\nBATEMAN\nThat's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the\nroom. Over there.\nHe points to another handsome young man with slicked-back\nhair and horn-rimmed glasses.\nMcDERMOTT\nWho is he with?\nPRICE\n(Distracted by the waitress's\ncleavage as she bends over to\nuncork a bottle of wine \u0096 the\nwaitress glares at him)\nSome weasel from Kicker Peabody.\nVan Patten returns.\nVAN PATTEN\nThey don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.\nMcDERMOTT\nAre you sure that's Paul Owen over there?\nPRICE\nYes. McDufus, I am.\nMcDERMOTT\nHe's handling the Fisher account.\nPRICE\nLucky bastard.\nMcDERMOTT\nLucky Jew bastard.\nBATEMAN\nOh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with\nanything?\nMcDERMOTT\nListen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the\nphone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The\nbastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.\nBATEMAN\nYou spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah.\nYou spin a dreidel.\nMcDERMOTT\nOh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up\nsome fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?\nBATEMAN\nNo. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.\nMcDERMOTT\nOh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the\nACLU.\nPrice leans over and pats Bateman on the back.\nPRICE\nThe voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking\nof reasonable...\nHe shows McDermott the bill for the meal.\nMcDERMOTT\nOnly $470.\nVAN PATTEN\n(Without irony)\nNot bad.\nThe others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap\ndown on the table."

So\nokay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big\ntits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I\nbuy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on\nspring break and she's practically blowing me in the\nChandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-\nBATEMAN\nWhoa, wait.

Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op\ntogether or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some\nchick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.\nPrice throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.\nMcDERMOTT\nAnyway, so we're back at my place and listen to\nthis. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking\nrhino tipsy, and get this-\nVAN PATTEN\nShe let you fuck her without a condom?\nMcDERMOTT\nThis is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens.

The room is impeccably neat, and oddly\nimpersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of\na design magazine.\nBATEMAN (V.0.)\nMy name is Patrick Bateman. I am\ntwenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden\nBuildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh\nfloor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.\nBateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to\nsee his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his\ntoilet.\nBATEMAN\n(V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a\nbalanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the\nmorning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice\npack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand\nnow.\nBateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.\nBateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living\nroom wearing the ice pack.\nCUT TO:\nA mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the\nshower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.\nBATEMAN (V.O.)\nAfter I remove the icepack, I use a deep\npore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a\nwater-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body\nscrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.\nBateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a\ngel facial masque.\nBATEMAN (V.O.)\nThen I apply an herb mint facial masque which\nI leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my\nroutine.\nBateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is\nstocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He\nbegins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in\nreadiness on the marble counter.\nBATEMAN (V.O.)\nI always use an after-shave lotion with little\nor no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes\nyou look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye\nbalm, followed by a final moisturizing \"protective\" lotion...\nBateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried,\ngiving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been\nwrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque\noff his face.\nBATEMAN (V.O.)\nThere is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some\nkind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an\nentity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold\ngaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you\nand maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably\ncomparable: I simply am not there."

We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes\nthe Walkman off.\nBATEMAN\n(Faintly irritable)\nWhat is it?\nJEAN\nPatrick?\nBATEMAN\n(Condescendingly)\nYe-es, Je-an?\nJEAN\nPatrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.\nBATEMAN\nWho?\nJEAN\nDetective Donald KIMBALL?\nSilence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the\ndrawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back\ncover of Sports Illustrated.\nBATEMAN\nTell him I'm at lunch.\nJEAN\n(whispering)\nPatrick, I think he knows you're here.\nIt's only ten-thirty.\nSilence.\nBATEMAN\nSend him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless\nphone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.\nBATEMAN\nNow, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion\nto your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good\nbuddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt\ncalls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...\nThe door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD\nKIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age -\nand good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of\nthe type Bateman and his friends might wear.\nKimball sits down and crosses his legs with a\nself-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to\ncarry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at\nhim curiously, noticing the silence.\nBATEMAN\n(Realizing that Kimball is staring at him)\nRight. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.\nBateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in\nexasperation.\nKIMBALL nods understandingly.\nBATEMAN\nListen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just\nwalked in...\n(He laughs inanely)\nJust joking...\n(Pause)\nNo don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John,\nright, got it.\n(He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in)\nSorry about that.\nKIMBALL\nNo, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.\n(Gesturing toward the phone)\nWas that anything important?\nBATEMAN\nOh that? Just mulling over business problems.\nExamining opportunities...Exchanging rumors...\nSpreading gossip.\nThey laugh politely.\nKIMBALL\n(Holding out his hand)\nHi. I'm Donald KIMBALL\nBATEMAN\n(Shaking firmly)\nHi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.\nKIMBALL\nI'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed\nto talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well,\nyou're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.\nKIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports\nIllustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk.\nBateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines\ninto the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is\nstill running.\nBATEMAN\n(Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed)\nSo, what's the topic of discussion?\nKIMBALL\nI've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate\nthe disappearance of Paul Owen.\nBATEMAN\nYou're not with the FBI or anything, are you?\nKIMBALL\nNothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.\nBATEMAN\nAh, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.\nKIMBALL\nSo it's nothing that official. I just have some\nbasic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-\nBATEMAN\nCoffee?\nKIMBALL\nNo. I'm okay.\nBATEMAN\nPerrier? San Pellegrino?\nKIMBALL\nNo, I'm okay.\nKIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold\nCross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes\nJean.\nJEAN (O.S.)\nPatrick?\nBATEMAN\nCan you bring Mr...\nKIMBALL\nKIMBALL.\nBATEMAN\nMr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-\nKIMBALL\nOh no, I'm okay.\nBATEMAN\nIt's no problem\nBateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down\nin his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters\nand places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched\nglass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman.\nHe glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.\nBATEMAN\nWell, what's the topic of discussion?\nKIMBALL\nThe disappearance of Paul Owen.\nBATEMAN\nOh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the\ndisappearance or anything...\n(Trying to laugh)\nNot on \"Page Six\" at least.\nKIMBALL\nI think his family wants this kept quiet.\nBATEMAN\nUnderstandable.\n(Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino)\nLime?\nKIMBALL\nNo, really. I'm okay.\nBATEMAN\nYou sure? I can always get you a lime.\nA pause.\nKIMBALL\nJust some preliminary questions that I need for my own\nfiles, okay?\nBATEMAN\nShoot.\nKIMBALL\nHow old are you?\nBATEMAN\nTwenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.\nKIMBALL\n(Scribbling in his notebook)\nWhere did you go to school?\nBATEMAN\nHarvard. The Harvard Business School.\nKIMBALL\nYour address?\nBATEMAN\nFifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American\nGardens Building.\nKIMBALL\n(Looking up, impressed)\nNice. Very nice.\nBATEMAN\n(Flattered)\nThanks.\nA pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his\neyes, as if in pain.\nKIMBALL\nPardon me, but are you okay?\nBATEMAN\nWho do you ask?\nKIMBALL\nYou seem...nervous.\nBateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a\nbottle of aspirin.\nBATEMAN\nNuprin?\nKIMBALL Uh...no, thanks.\nKimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the\ndesk.\nBATEMAN\nBad habit.\nKIMBALL\nI know. I'm sorry.\nA pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.\nKIMBALL\nWould you rather I not smoke?\nBATEMAN\nNo, I guess it's okay.\nKIMBALL\nYou sure?\nBATEMAN\nNo problem.\n(Buzzing Jean)\nJEAN (O.S.)\nYes, Patrick?\nBATEMAN\nBring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please.\nShe whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.\nKIMBALL\nWhat can you tell me about Paul Owen?\nBATEMAN\nWell...\nHe coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows\nthem dry.\nKIMBALL\nHow well did you know him?\nBATEMAN\nI'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing,\nyou know.\nKIMBALL\nYale thing?\nA pause.\nBATEMAN\nYeah...Yale thing.\nKIMBALL\nWhat do you mean...Yale thing?\nA pause.\nBATEMAN\nWell, I think for one that he was probably a closet\nhomosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.\nA silence during which the sound of the air conditioner\nbecomes deafening.\nKIMBALL\nSo...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul\nOwen?\nBATEMAN\nHe led what I suppose was an orderly life. He...\nate a balanced diet.\nKIMBALL\nWhat kind of man was he? Besides...\n(He hesitates tries to smile)\nthe information you've just given.\nBATEMAN\nI hope I'm not being cross-examined here.\nKIMBALL\nDo you feel that way?\nBATEMAN\nNo. Not really.\nKIMBALL\n(As he writes without looking up)\nWhere did Paul hang out?\nBATEMAN\nHang...out?\nKIMBALL\nYeah. You know...hang out.\nBATEMAN\nLet me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine.\nNell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular\nplaces.\nKIMBALL\nHe had a yacht?\nBATEMAN\nNo, he just hung out there.\nKIMBALL\nAnd where did he go to school?\nA slight pause.\nBATEMAN\nDon't you know this?\nKIMBALL\nI just wanted to know if you know.\nBATEMAN\nBefore Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's...\nListen, I just...I just want to help.\nKIMBALL\nI understand.\nHe makes another note.\nKIMBALL\nAnything else you can tell me about Owen?\nBATEMAN\nWe were both seven in 1969.\nKIMBALL\n(Smiles)\nSo was I.\nBATEMAN\nDo you have any witnesses or fingerprints?\nKIMBALL\nWell, there's a message on his answering machine saying he\nwent to London.\nBATEMAN\nWell, maybe he did, huh?\nKIMBALL\nHis girlfriend doesn't think so.\nBATEMAN\nBut...has anyone seen him in London?\nKIMBALL\nActually, yes.\nBATEMAN\nHmmm.\nKIMBALL\nWell, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification.\nA Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but\nI checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert\nAinsworth for Paul, so...\nBATEMAN\nOh.\nKIMBALL\nWas he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan\nworship?\nBATEMAN\nWhat?\nKIMBALL\nI know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I\nknow this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't\nknow if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was\nrecently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano\ngirl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-\nBATEMAN\nYikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced\ndiet and-\nKIMBALL\nYeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.\nA pause - the longest so far.\nBATEMAN\nHave you consulted a psychic?\nKIMBALL\nNo.\nBATEMAN\nHad his apartment been burglarized?\nKIMBALL\nNo, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A\nsuit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.\nBATEMAN\nI mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet\nor anything, right?\nKIMBALL\nNo, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But...\nbasically no one has seen or heard anything.\nBATEMAN\nThat's so typical, isn't it?\nKIMBALL\nIt's just strange.\n(He stares out the window, lost in thought)\nOne day someone's walking around, going to work, alive,\nand then...\nBATEMAN\nNothing.\nKIMBALL\nPeople just...disappear.\nBATEMAN\nThe earth just opens up and swallows people.\n(He checks his Rolex)\nKIMBALL\nEerie. Really eerie.\nSilence.\nBATEMAN\n(Standing up)\nYou'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting\nwith Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.\nKIMBALL\nIsn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I\nmean aren't you going to be late?\nBATEMAN\nUh, no. There's one...down here.\nKIMBALL\nOh really? I didn't know that.\nBateman leads him to the door.\nBATEMAN\nYes. It's very good.\nKIMBALL turns to face him.\nKIMBALL\nListen, if anything occurs to you, any information\nat all...\nBATEMAN\nAbsolutely, I'm 100% with you.\nKIMBALL\nGreat, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.\nBateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his\neyes and leans against the door, sweating."

Get on your knees.\nChristie shrugs.\nBATEMAN\nI want to watch. You have a very nice body.\nThe doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.\nBATEMAN\nThank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry\noff, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and\nour guest in the living room for drinks.\nBateman answers the door.\nBATEMAN\nYou've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat.\nI'm Paul. How good of you to come.\nThe escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes\nher coat and inspects her body and face.\nBATEMAN\nNot quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm\ngoing to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.\nBateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a\nglass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the\ncouch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a\nlong silence.\nBATEMAN\nSo, don't you want to know what I do?\nThe two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles.\nChristie shrugs.\nCHRISTIE\nNo.\nSABRINA\n(Smiling)\nNo, not really.\nBateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.\nBATEMAN\nWell, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce.\n(Long pause)\nHave you heard of it?\nAnother long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands\nup and goes over to the CD collection.\nCHRISTIE\nYou have a really nice place here...Paul.\nHow much did you pay for it?\nBATEMAN\nActually, that's none of your business, Christie,\nhut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.\nBateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a\npack of cigarettes out of her purse.\nBateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.\nBATEMAN\nNo, no smoking.

Sabrina\ntakes one.\nBATEMAN\nI don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very\nfine Chardonnay you're not drinking.\nBateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection.\nHe takes one out and examines it.\nBATEMAN\nDo you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis\nfan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before\nthat I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too\nartsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins'\npresence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out\nanother one.\nBATEMAN\nI think \"Invisible Touch\" is the group's undisputed\nmasterpiece.\nHe puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him\ninto the bedroom.\nBATEMAN\nIt's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the\nsame time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding\nthree albums. Christie, take off the robe.\nBateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to\nput it on.\nBATEMAN\nListen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,\nCollins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance\nof every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.\nBateman starts to undress.\nBATEMAN\nIn terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer\nsongwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.\nSabrina, why don't you dance a little?\nSabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.\nBATEMAN\nTake the lyrics to \"Land of Confusion.\" In this\nsong, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political\nauthority.\nBateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather\nmenacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves.\nBATEMAN\n\"In Too Deep\" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about\nmonogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting.\nTheir lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything\nI've heard in rock.\nHe turns on the video camera.\nBATEMAN\nChristie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your\nasshole.\nBateman looks through the viewfinder.\nBATEMAN\nPhill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and\ntherefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially\nsongs like \"In the Air Tonight\" and \"Against\nAll Odds.\" Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.\nHe walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in\nthe CD.\nBATEMAN\nBut I also think that Phill Collins works better\nwithin the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and\nI stress the word artist. This is \"Sussudio,\" a great,\ngreat song, a personal favorite.\nSEX MONTAGE CUT TO \"Sussudio.\" We see this in WIDE SHOT, or\nthrough the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.\nCUT TO:\nBateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina\non either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his\nwrist. Bateman's eyes open.\nBATEMAN\nDon't touch the Rolex.\nBateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.\nHe opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger,\na rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns\naround to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up\nand get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.\nBATEMAN\nWe're not through yet...\nCUT TO:\nBateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They\nare both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a\ndeep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the\nb.g. Phil Collins' \"In the Air Tonight\" is playing."

We be jammin'...\nThe man walks by, shaking his head.\nBateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a\nmore familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in\nblack designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott\nand Price sitting with three models, all wearing black\nmini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered\nargument.\nPRICE\nI have to talk to these girls? They're models.\nMcDERMOTT\nSomeone has to get the Bolivian marching powder.\nYou went last time. Stay here.\nMcDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.\nBateman looks at the models.

So...it was hot out today, no?\nSilence.\nLIBBY\nWhere did Craig go?\nPRICE\nWell, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to\nsign a peace treaty with him between the United States\nand Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.\nLIBBY\nWell...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.\nPRICE\nYou're not confused, are you?\nLIBBY\nNo, not really.\nCARON\nGorbachev's not downstairs.\nDAISY\n(Smiling)\nAre you Iying?\nPRICE\nYes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's\nat Tunnel.\nBATEMAN\n(To Daisy)\nAsk me a question.\nDAISY\nSo, what do you do?\nBATEMAN\nWhat do you think I do?\nDAISY\nA model? An actor?\nBATEMAN\nNo. Flattering, but no.\nDAISY\nWell...\nBATEMAN\nI m into, well, murders and executions mostly.\nDAISY (Unfazed)\nDo you like it?\nBATEMAN\nWelt...it depends, why?\nDAISY\nWell, most guys I know who work in mergers and\nacquisitions don't really like it.\nSilence.\nBATEMAN\nSo, where do you work out?\nMUCH LATER IN THE EVENING:\nThe club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a\nbalcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him\nin a menacing way that suggests he might push him over\nthe railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman\nis reaching for him.\nPRICE\n(Shouting)\nI'm leaving. I'm getting out.\nBATEMAN\nLeaving what?\nPRICE\nThis.\nBateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his\ndrink.\nBATEMAN\nDon't, I'll drink it.\nPRICE\n(Screaming)\nListen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.\nBATEMAN\nWhere to? Are you going to go get a gram?\nPRICE\nI'm leaving! I...am...leaving!\nBATEMAN\nDon't tell me...merchant banking?\nPRICE\nNo, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm\ndisappearing.\nBATEMAN\n(laughing)\nWhere to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?\nPrice looks away.\nMcDermott and Daisy walk up to them.\nMcDERMOTT\nHey-don't worry, be happy.\nPrice lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is\nshouting something that can't be heard, then\nPRICE\nGoodbye! Fuckheads!\nHe climbs over the railing.\nDAISY What is he doing?\nBATEMAN\nPrice! Come back!\nPrice leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment\nthen resurfaces and runs off into the crowd."

Bateman pulls his hand away.\nEVELYN\n(Sobbing)\nWhat do you want me to do, what is it you want?\nThe occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is\nbecoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.\nBATEMAN\n(Looking uncomfortably around the room)\nIf you really want to do something for me, you can stop making\nthis scene right now.\nEVELYN\nOh God, I can't believe this.\nBATEMAN\nI'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.\nEvelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the\ntears so they will not affect her make-up.\nEVELYN\n(Surprisingly calm)\nWhere are you going?\nBATEMAN\nI'm just leaving.\nEVELYN\nBut where?\nBATEMAN\nI have to return some videotapes.\nHe rushes out of the room."
