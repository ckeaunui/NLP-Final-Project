      "text": "Get rid of this scum. We got it. On your feet. Walk, just walk. Start walking. Talking's good, walking's better. If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch. Jack. IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?! Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming. I thought I'd take some now. Oh? What's the problem? Tell you what? What problem? I guess. Why not? How was Chicago? You're going to use Walter? Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? He won't be back in a hurry? Sure. If the main character does. Always. Give me the God damn gum. Jack? I believe we did have a young man named Jack. Not a reliable man, as I recall. Constantly late or behind in his work. Higher. Higher. Right, right. Good. Jack we're in position. Jack. Jack. OK. Taking Golitsyn's exit. Jack, open the doors. He's got it. Saved your ass again Jack. Sarah's reconsidering. Claire, transport in five minutes. In position. Jack open the door, let the package roll. Stairway, you're wrapped, go to transport. Cut the power. Cut the power Jack. Do you hear me. Jack. Jack. Jim. Jim. He's in the open. Can you lose him? Jim we can't. Negative, Golitsyn's on the move. Sarah eye on the package. Jim, I'm coming to you. No, we're going to recover the disk, understand?! Now move! About two hundred yards from the bridge. JIM! CLAIRE! Central Europe. Unsecured. Bravo Echo one one. Go secure. They're dead. My team. Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- don't know They knew we were coming. Golitsyn's dead too. The disk is gone. Do you read me? The list is in the open! I don't think so. Yes. You're in Prague? No sir. Yeah. Yeah. I follow you. You mean I've lost enough agents for one night. Who else is left? Why was there another team? Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight. Let's see if you can follow me around this room. The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team. You're worried about me. Why? The arms dealer. But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. This whole operation was a molehunt. How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole. Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset. Job. Job 3:14. March fourteen. Job 31 March. Job three fourteen. Job It's Job! Max -- Goods tainted. Consider extremely hazardous. DO NOT USE. Fate will be that of kings and counsellors who built for themselves palaces now lying in ruins. Must meet to discuss a.s.a.p. What are you doing here?! Don't move. You were in the car! Shut up! I saw you. You were in the car. Don't give me that! I was on the bridge. There was nobody on the bridge. Dead. Dead. Dead! Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead, they're dead. They're all dead! Take off your coat. Take off your God damn coat! That was four hours ago! Who sent you? Did they send you here? Did they send you Did they send you? Who sent you?! Who sent you? I've been disavowed. They think I killed Jim and everyone else. Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account. Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list. I'm going to get it for him. Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me. CLAIRE Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me. I'm going to answer it. Excuse me, could I trouble you for a match? Why? I thought I was going to see Max. Then what am I doing here? I don't communicate very well through a shroud. I'm willing to take the chance. I need one hundred thousand dollars. Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand. That depends. Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The disk Job sold you is worthless. It's bait, part of an internal molehunt. Like Job? I'm NOC. Was. Now disavowed. That's the question I want to ask Job. Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction. Because I can deliver the actual NOC list. The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location. Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits. Tell you what. How good's the RF scanner you used in the car? Okay, use it. But I suggest pack up first. I'd say you've got about two minutes. Thanks, Max. Or is it Maxine? What was your deal with Job? Ten million. Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached. And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange. How will you make sure Job will be there? I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money. I wouldn't dream of it. I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job. You're sure about this? We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local. Simple game. Four players. Exfil opens the pocket cyber ops lifts the wallet. IMF mainframe. In Langley. Information. Profitable. This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of. What'd they used to call you? The Net Ranger? Phineas Phreak? The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom. You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks. May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you. Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses. Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down. May I come in? It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away. I didn't say that. I just need you to be safe. What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply. I lost the team. I just need you to be safe. Sorry. We picked up alarms in sectors three, seven, and twelve. What sector's the air conditioning? I gotta go in there and shut it down! Do you want to blow the fire through the whole building? Let's move! Zero body count. Time up. 1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast. Luther, I'm going in. Don't disappoint me Krieger, from here on in, absolute silence. We're not outta here yet. My contact is extremely shy. Don't you mean this? What's the matter, you don't know this trick? I thought you had it! Do you actually think I'd let you have the NOC list? We did what we had to do. Now I want you to hold onto it. Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it. Exactly, that's your job. Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. What's the range of this thing? I'll get you close. Kittridge Don't don't touch me He's expecting my call. I'm going to the station And I'm going to call him. Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was an especially nice touch. If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse? - and picked us up in the States - Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records - You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street. I remember.. Jim, who do you think you're kidding? A doctor's gotta look at that. You can't sit up straight. Kitteridge. Oh my god! Kittridge is the mole? How did Kittridge do it?.. Why, Jim? Why? We don't have to, Jim. He'll come after us. What he didn't get in Prague. The NOC list. A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris. If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. I'll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train. Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris. Jim ? You're probably right. Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash. I'll call you from Paris. And get a doctor. I sent the message to Max. We're on for tomorrow. Is this the only way? Kittridge is Job. Max delivered. How far is he from Luther? You are my eyes. Stay with him. Of course - I'm sorry to hear you say that Claire. Before London. But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago. I knew about Jim. You've earned it. Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town? Aren't you going to thank me Jim. Ten million is better than six. You're wrong about one thing. I'm not the only one who's seen you alive. Jim, it's over. Claire Hey Claire. I always have, Claire.. Red light, green light. Asta Lasagna mother fucker. About what? Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys. Here's to you, Luther. To being off the disavowed list. You're more than that, Luther. They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it. They want you back in. You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing? It's all one big negotiation, isn't it? Just don't know why I'd be doing it. He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough. Gotta catch my flight.. So. How's it feel being a solid citizen again? Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way. No, thank you."

      "text": " No, I prefer the theatre. Perhaps you'd choose one for me. A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want. After this one. What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too. I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again. You were in Kiev. You tell me. When you started noticing your short term memory loss. What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev? Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here? Ethan, you can't burn out. Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out. Wonderful. Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel. You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years? His wife's got a year old kid. So he says All right. Who was it? My friend Harry? She says no. Oh, it was my friend Sammy. She says it wasn't Sammy. Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou. No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?! He's our guy. Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You think the plot'll work? If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable? Are you gonna take it? Thank you. Ethan. Jack's inside. Window's open by twenty-three hundred. Sarah, mark the package and go to two. Hannah. He's marked. Lets go. Hannah -- I'm blind again. Hannah. Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you. He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box! Opening the doors. Go under. Jack, what are you doing?! I don't have it -- I don't have control! Man down. Stay where you are. I'm on my way. En route. Ethan, what are you doing? You're a hard man to catch up with. ..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases. - but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places.. - so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy. Hey, I showed 'em to you! I can sit up straight. I just can't..sit up straight very well. It's not important! I saw who shot me. Ethan, I saw the mole. It was Kittridge. Kittridge! Yeah. ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War. No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself. Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - without your permission. The son-of-a- bitch! How dare he? You realize it's over, you're an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, you've got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year. Kittridge, we'll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time! What's going to make him do that? Jesus, Ethan. Good for you. Tight security. No guns. Real plus. I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking I'm dead and gone. God knows what she's had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I.. - no. She can't know about me. No one can. Not til this is over. There's too much at stake, Ethan. I usually am. You got it. Good luck. Yes. Ethan Hunt, darling. Remember him? Course he did. Just exactly when he knew is something of a question. Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan? They stamped it, didn't they? Those damn Gideons. Two minutes til Krieger shows. This'll have to be quicker than I'd like. Certainly quicker than you'd like. Why the masquerade? Why take the risk? Well, Claire, you've asked the question and you are the answer. But, he didn't know about you. In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods. Thou shall not covet thy Neighbour's wife , Ethan. Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it. And like all the world's lovers, he's tortured by the same, one pathetic question - does she feel the same way I do? Well Claire do you? Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them? Count it. Keep counting Claire. Satisfied? Fold it. Fold it tight. Don't flatter yourself - six was for Eastern Europe. You made a lousy deal - ten for the world? What is that? But I needed you for the transfer with Max. I got a little extra change; and you got a little extra too. Sorry Ethan. Times up. Say goodbye. You son of a bitch. Now we don't have to eliminate him? You like that, don't you Claire? Don't you? Ethan - I've always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth. It can kill you. "
